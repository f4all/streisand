By using this information, people can connect through their old dialup modems and get online.<br />
The dialup services are provided in cooperation with friendly and trusted European Internet Service Providers. Since the number of lines is limited, do not use them if you don't need to!
<p>(Also; please note that the service is free of charge, but you still need to pay for the phone connection from where ever you are to the modem pool of your choise.)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR DIAL-UP (LAND-LINE) INTERNET CONNECTION<br />
  <br />
Connecting via dial-up to a volunteer provider of Internet access<br />
Note: These instructions are for the user of the internet connection<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1</strong>: Get your equipment together</p>
<p>You will need:<br />
</p>
<p>-A computer with a 56K modem<br />
</p>
<p>In  most cases there is already a modem in your computer. If you want to check on a Windows system, right-click My Computer, choose Manage &gt; Device manager &gt; Modems. If  something is listed under Modems, it is what you need. You may need to update the driver by right-clicking the modem and choosing Update driver.</p>
<p><br />
  -A land-line telephone service (old fashioned telephone line with a cord to the wall)<br />
  You do not need to have a dial-up internet provider account at all - the  volunteer Internet provider (see below) will be your ISP (Internet Service Provider).</p>
<p><br />
  -A telephone line with the little connectors that look like a LAN connection, only smaller, attaching your computer to the telephone connection box.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Follow the instructions at <a href="http://www.dialup4less.com/dialupsupport.html">http://www.dialup4less.com/dialupsupport.html</a><br />
  </p>
<p>Find your operating system and select that tutorial.<br />
  </p>
<p>Note:  Make sure to locate and copy all of these instructions and tutorials before getting started! You will not be able to get to them when the Internet goes down, so print them out and place them somewhere safe!<br />
  </p>
<p>The instructions in your tutorial should be followed exactly except for:<br />
  </p>
<p>The ISP name is whatever you want (e.g. Telecomix Dial-Up Internet)<br />
  </p>
<p>The phone number will chosen be from the list of available numbers<br />
  </p>
<p>The username will be the one listed with the number you are using<br />
  </p>
<p>The password will the the one listed with the number you are using<br />
  </p>
<p>Pick a number to dial in to from the current list of available dial-up Internet access numbers. (Backup extended list <a href="https://pastee.org/cs2nk">https://pastee.org/cs2nk</a> and <a href="http://pastebin.com/QYP3tvFa">http://pastebin.com/QYP3tvFa</a>)<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:  These lists will also be difficult or impossible to access without the  Internet, so keep an updated version available in the event of an Internet shutdown in your area.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Step 3</strong>: Use the internet as you would normally<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Avoid using Internet Explorer! Use Mozilla Firefox.<br />
Expect pages to load much more slowly than normal, or not at all in some cases. You will probably not be able to see streaming video or news channels due to the slow connection. You should be able to see able to see other pages but they will take minutes instead of seconds to load up. Use this connection for emergency situations only, for relaying IRC messages for Tweets or such, not more.</p>
<p>Be safe, always.</p>
<p>We are Telecomix. We love data. And you.<br />
