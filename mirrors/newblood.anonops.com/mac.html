 <h1>Setting Up IRC on Mac OS X</h1>
</div>
<div class="dividertwo"></div>

<h3>X-Chat Azure</h3>
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    1. Download X-Chat Azure from the App Store or follow this link: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xchat-azure/id447521961?mt=12">App Store Azure</a>
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    2. Open up X-Chat Azure.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    3. Two windows should pop up, a smaller one that says "XChat: Network List" and a larger one.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    4. In the smaller window fill out the nick name and user name spaces. You will also need to change the entered real name since it will auto-fill with your the name attached to your computer (which isn't good for staying anonymous).
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    5. At the bottom of the smaller window it should have buttons reading:
    +, -, show details, connect, connect in a new tab. Click the + button and then enter in a new network name (ex. anonops).
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    6. Now click the "show details" button. Here you need to enter in "irc.anonops.com" in the hostname column where it says "NewServer"
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    7. In the port column enter "6697" and then check the "SSL" box
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    8. Along the top of the details window click on the section marked "connecting." Here check the boxes "use SSL for all the servers on this network" and "accept invalid ssl certificate."
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    9. Now in the "XChat: Network List" window you can click "hide details" and then connect. You should now be ready to register your nick etc.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    Now when ever you want to connect you just highlight your created Anonops network and click connect. Also, after you register you can enter your password in the password section of the window in step 8 and it will log you in automatically.
<div class="divider"></div>
<h4>Tor with Xchat Azure</h4>
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
	<p>After you have obtained access to the Tor server you will need to make some changes to the setup of Xchat Azure. Using the directions above, make a New Network like AnonopsTor that will be used with Tor since the server address and port are different. The server will be anonops532vcpz6z.onion and the port is 443. Make sure the User Name under your nickname is the ident/username you have registered for Tor.</p>
	<div class="dividerthree"></div>
	<p>Then open Xchat Azure preferences and select Network Setup. Where it says Proxy Server enter localhost, 9150, SOCKS5, All Connections, in that order. Change nothing else on that page. Click OK. You should now be able to connect using Tor.</p>
	<div class="dividerthree"></div>
	<p>To use a non-Tor network, you will have to come back to this preference and choose (disabled) for the proxy type. You can leave the other fields as they are.</p>
<div class="divider"></div>	
 <h3>Colloquy</h3>
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    1. Download Colloquy from the following link: <a href="http://www.colloquy.info/">Colloquy</a>
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    2. Open Colloquy.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    3. A Connections window will open.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    4. Click New and a New Connection window will open.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    5. Type the Nickname you want. Server protocol is IRC. Chat Server type in irc.anonops.com
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    6. Now click the "details" button and check the box "Remember this connection"
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    7. In the port column enter "6697" and then check the "SSL" box
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    8. Username: just make up something. This is not your nick, but it can be.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    9. Server Password: leave blank (this is not your nick register password)
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    10. Real Name: obviously NOT.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    11. Click Connect.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    12. A bigger window should open but if not, highlight your new connection in the Connections window and click Console. There you should see status messages showing you connecting to the server. At the bottom is the dialog box and you can type /list or /join #roomyouwant.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    Now whenever you want to connect you just highlight your created Anonops network and click connect.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    After you register your nick, the next time you connect Colloquy will ask for the password you set, and here you can check the box to remember your password and it will log you in automatically.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    You can fine tune your connection details by highlighting the connection in the Connections window and click Info. Here you can see your password and other info. Click the Automatic tab and select "Open Console on connect" if desired. You can also automatically join rooms listed here.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
    <em>Colloquy weirdness: Sometimes after clicking connect, nothing seems to be happening. Wait a bit, sometimes it takes a while to connect.</em>
