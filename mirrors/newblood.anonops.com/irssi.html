<h1>irssi IRC Client for Linux</h1></div>
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
<p>This tutorial uses Debian as an example. The procedure is similar for other distros.<br />
To begin, we first need the application. Open up a terminal and use your package manager and place it in the path of your choice.<br>
Your package manager should have installed SSL. If not, do so now.</p><br />
<strong>sudo apt-get install irssi</strong><br />
Next, run the program. In the terminal type:<br>
<strong>irssi</strong><br />
<img src="images/irssism.png" alt="" /><br />
Click <a href="images/irssi.png" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a> for a larger image.<br />
This first run is done not only to test the program installed correctly but also to create the <cite>.irssi</cite> in the users home directory.<br />
Type <strong>exit</strong> to close the program.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
Next, we configure the client to connect to AnonOpsIRC. This is done by editing the configuration file with your favorite editor, which is of course, nano.<br />
<strong>nano ~/.irssi/config</strong><br />
The examples shown are copied from a working irssi client. You can copypasta them into your config file then save it.<br> 
<strong>NOTE: You need to replace <cite>YOURNICK</cite> and <cite>YOURPASSWORD</cite> with your own information.</strong><br />
First we want to add the servers:
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
<pre>servers = (
  {
    address = "irc.anonops.com";
    chatnet = "AnonOps";
    port = "6697";
    use_ssl = "yes";
    ssl_verify = "no";
    autoconnect = "yes";
  }
);</pre>
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
Next, we add the network and define a few things:<br />
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
<pre>chatnets = {
  AnonOps = {
    type = "IRC";
    nick = "YOURNICK";
    autosendcmd = "/msg nickserv identify <b>YOURPASSWORD</b>; wait 2000";
  };
};<br />
channels = (
  { name = "#anonops"; chatnet = "AnonOps"; autojoin = "yes"; },	
);</pre>
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
You have now set the network to join, saved your nick and password and set to autojoin the main channel.<br />
You can edit this section later to add additional channels to autojoin on connect.<br>
Next we will add some aliases. Aliases are shortened versions of standard IRC commands.<br />
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
The configuration information below is available to download <a href="irssi.conf" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>. Just append it to the existing file using nano.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
<pre>aliases = {
  J = "join";

<div class="dividerthree"></div>
This section controls the look of the client window and the status bars. You can modify these later to suit your preferences.<br />
<pre>statusbar = {
  # formats:
  # when using {templates}, the template is shown only if it's argument isn't
  # empty unless no argument is given. for example {sb} is printed always,
  # but {sb $T} is printed only if $T isn't empty.

  items = {
    # start/end text in statusbars
    barstart = "{sbstart}";
    barend = "{sbend}";

    topicbarstart = "{topicsbstart}";
    topicbarend = "{topicsbend}";

    # treated "normally", you could change the time/user name to whatever
    time = "{sb $Z}";
    user = "{sb {sbnickmode $cumode}$N{sbmode $usermode}{sbaway $A}}";

    # treated specially .. window is printed with non-empty windows,
    # window_empty is printed with empty windows
    window = "{sb $winref:$tag/$itemname{sbmode $M}}";
    window_empty = "{sb $winref{sbservertag $tag}}";
    prompt = "{prompt $[.15]itemname}";
    prompt_empty = "{prompt $winname}";
    topic = " $topic";

    # all of these treated specially, they're only displayed when needed
    lag = "{sb Lag: $0-}";
    act = "{sb Act: $0-}";
    more = "-- more --";
  };

  # there's two type of statusbars. root statusbars are either at the top
  # of the screen or at the bottom of the screen. window statusbars are at
  # the top/bottom of each split window in screen.
  default = {
    # the "default statusbar" to be displayed at the bottom of the window.
    # contains all the normal items.
    window = {
      disabled = "no";

      # window, root
      type = "window";
      # top, bottom
      placement = "bottom";
      # number
      position = "1";
      # active, inactive, always
      visible = "active";

      # list of items in statusbar in the display order
      items = {
        barstart = { priority = "100"; };
        time = { };
        user = { };
        window = { };
        window_empty = { };
        lag = { priority = "-1"; };
        act = { priority = "10"; };
        more = { priority = "-1"; alignment = "right"; };
        barend = { priority = "100"; alignment = "right"; };
      };
    };

    # statusbar to use in inactive split windows
    window_inact = {
      type = "window";
      placement = "bottom";
      position = "1";
      visible = "inactive";
      items = {

        more = { priority = "-1"; alignment = "right"; };
        barend = { priority = "100"; alignment = "right"; };
      };
    };

    # we treat input line as yet another statusbar :) It's possible to
    # add other items before or after the input line item.
    prompt = {
      type = "root";
      placement = "bottom";
      # we want to be at the bottom always
      position = "100";
      visible = "always";
      items = {
        prompt = { priority = "-1"; };
        prompt_empty = { priority = "-1"; };
        # treated specially, this is the real input line.
        input = { priority = "10"; };
      };
    };

    # topicbar
    topic = {
      type = "root";
      placement = "top";

      visible = "always";
      items = {

        topic = { };
        topic_empty = { };
        topicbarend = { priority = "100"; alignment = "right"; };
      };
    };
  };
};
settings = {
  core = { real_name = "SomeNameHere"; user_name = "<b>YOURNICK</b>"; nick = "<b>YOURNICK</b>"; };
  "fe-text" = { actlist_sort = "refnum"; };
};</pre>
Save the config file now.
<div class="dividerthree"></div>
Wow. so config. many lines. much confusion.<br />
Now to run the program. In the terminal type <strong>irssi</strong><br>
Your terminal should look like this:<br />
<img src="images/irssi2sm.png" alt="" /><br />
Click <a href="images/irssi2.png" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a> for a larger image.<br>
Everything look ok? Good. You have done well.<br>
To cycle through the different channels you enter the /win command followed by the number of that window.<br>
/win 1<br>
/win 2<br>
/win 3<br>
Etc, etc. Note that irssi can have up to 14 channels opened at once. Each number represents a different channel.<br>

You can also change windows by pressing <cite>ALT + (1-9)</cite>. Using <cite>ALT + 0</cite> displays window 10.<br>
From there, <cite>ALT + (q-p)</cite> cycles thru windows 11-20. 
If you have any problems, first google any errors or read the documentation.<br />
