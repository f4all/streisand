<li> Manufacturing and Sources of Supplies
</li>
</ul>
<p>"Comverse’s manufacturing operations consist primarily of installing its software on externally purchased hardware components and final assembly and testing, which involves the application of extensive quality control procedures to materials, components, subassemblies and systems. Comverse primarily uses third parties to perform modules and subsystem assembly, component testing and sheet metal fabrication. These <b>manufacturing operations are performed primarily in the United States, Israel, Canada, China, France, Germany and Hong Kong</b>. 
</p><p>Although Comverse generally uses standard parts and components in its products, certain components and sub-assemblies are presently available only from a limited number of sources. To date, Comverse has been able to obtain adequate supplies of all components and subassemblies in a timely manner from existing sources or, when necessary, from alternative sources or redesign the system to incorporate new modules, when applicable. However, the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components or to locate alternative sources of supply if and as required in the future, would adversely affect its operations. "
