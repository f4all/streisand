'''Deep Packet Inspection'''

* [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/routers/ps9343/qa_c67-695977.html Routers and integration] 

"'''[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/routers/ps9343/qa_c67-695977.pdf Application Visibility and Control (AVC)]''' is a solution that uses multiple technologies of the '''[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9343/index.html Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers]''' and [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10536/prod_models_home.html Cisco Integrated Service Routers]  [http://www.cisco.com/assets/prod/rt/isr/whats-new-isrg2.html Generation 2 (ISR G2)] and management tools that, when working together, provide a powerful and pervasive integrated solution for application visibility and control based on stateful deep packet inspection (DPI)."

'''Data Collection'''

* [http://blogs.cisco.com/security/correlating-netflow-data-for-proactive-security-network-notoriety/ NetFlow]blog by Mike Schiffman

"NetFlow is a UDP-exported network profiling protocol originally developed by Cisco Systems in 1996. It enables participating devices (typically routers and switches) to report telemetry data on the network traffic flowing through them (such a device is called a NetFlow exporter). This data is sent to a downstream machine, called a NetFlow Collector: [http://blogs.cisco.com/wp-content/uploads/NF02-1.jpg see Diagram]...
'''[ NetFlow version 9]''' introduced much more power with the '''capability to dynamically change the packet format''' using templates and match on just about anything using Flexible NetFlow.

'''If packet capture can be thought of as a wiretap, NetFlow can be considered the phone bill.''' NetFlow allows the Network Administrator and Security Practitioner to determine:

* '''Who is talking to who'''

* '''Over what ports (or protocols)'''

* '''For how long'''

* '''At what speed'''


'''Data Mining''' for Misuse: NetFlow flows, when aggregated, can provide an excellent target for data mining. Suspicious, unusual, or even illegal behaviors can be tracked and trended.
