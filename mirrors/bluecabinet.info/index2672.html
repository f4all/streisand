</p><p>June 12, 2007 Intelligentias filed for rebranding (?) or to register the brand <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.trademarkia.com/interceptia-77203945.html">Interceptia</a>. Which appears to have been later <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=77203945">abandoned</a> along with the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nvannualreport.com/entities-DPC-INTERCEPTIA-INC.aspx">incorporation</a>.
</p><p>After acquisition of a couple of companies in 2007, board of directors bailed ship. 
</p><p>"On September 2, 2008, Intelligentias, Inc. (the "Company") received the written resignations of all the senior executives and members of the Board of Directors. Ian W. Rice resigned as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Luigi Caramico resigned as President and a member of the Board; Mario Mene´ resigned as Chief Technical Officer and a member of the Board; Danilo Cacciamatta resigned as a member of the Board and Chairman of the Audit Committee; and Thomas A. Spanier resigned as Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary. Separately, Royston Hoggarth resigned as a member of the Board on August 26, 2008. Mr. Rice has agreed to remain as the sole director until September 15, 2008.
</p><p>As disclosed in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2008, without additional financing the Company does not have the ability to continue as a going concern. During the past two months senior management solicited financing proposals and received term sheets from several parties indicating that they are willing to provide financing, subject to appropriate due diligence and acceptable accommodations from the Company's principal stockholders and creditors. After extensive discussions with all parties, the Company's management was unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to all of the relevant constituencies that would allow any proposed financing opportunity to go forward.
</p><p>After carefully reviewing all of the circumstances of the financing efforts and available alternatives, the senior executives and Board concluded that they had no viable options that would allow them to continue operating the Company. Therefore, they tendered their resignations." <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=6137582-955-5704&amp;type=sect&amp;TabIndex=2&amp;companyid=669240&amp;ppu=%252fdefault.aspx%253fcik%253d1322387">EDGAR online SEC filings</a>
