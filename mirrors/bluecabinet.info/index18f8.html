'''Deep Packet Inspection/Lawful Interception/Web Filtering, including Identification and Location of occupants and blocking of websites.'''

"But it is possible to match the service to just to the house, but to it’s occupants, all sharing the same IP address." and 

"Beyond the selections of the FortiGuard web services, overrides and custom configurations, are the firewall policies that instruct the FortiGate how to determine which users can see what sites and when." [http://blog.fortinet.com/tag/fortigate/page/2/ Fortinet Blog] by founder Michael Xie.



* [http://www.fortinet.com/products/fortigate/50B.html FortiGate 51B] (DPI-capable) used to block protocols, that are used to block VPN protocols, OpenVPN, L2TP, PPTP, IPSec and virtually protocol with recognizable signature. DPI is made through their so-called IPS system, which is fully documented [https://resources.telecomix.ceops.eu/material/fortinet-Syria/FortiGate_IPS_Guide_01_30005_0080_20070725.pdf there].

* [http://www.fortiguard.com/webfiltering/webfiltering.html FortiGuard Web Filtering]

* [http://www.fortinet.com/press_releases/110816.html FortiGate-3950B] provides Deep Packet Inspection and is being used by SK Telecom. "'''Headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, SK Telecom''' builds on its strong innovation, market leadership and global partnerships, to bring a host of exciting mobile technologies, such as Mobile In Vehocle, Smart Payment among others, to end-users in the international market.

In 2009, the company's revenue reached KRW 12.1 trillion and net income was KRW 1.29 trillion."

* FortiGate Web Filtering in a Cloud - Configuration made simple
"Configuring the FortiGate unit '''is as simple as selecting which categories to block and allow, and if desired, log URL access to monitor the browsing habits of your employees'''. But what if you have your own set of web sites you want included, or excluded? 

'''FortiOS''' (see a [https://resources.telecomix.ceops.eu/material/fortinet-Syria/inside-fortios-ips-40-mr3.pdf quick presentation of its DPI-capabilities]) enables you to create your own web filtering profiles, where you can select the specific combination of allowed, blocked and monitored categories, and apply them to specific firewall policies. This combination of low-latency cloud-based web filtering services and local customization and configuration create a powerful, high-performance and flexible web filtering solution that only Fortinet can provide." [http://blog.fortinet.com/tag/fortigate/page/2/ Micheal Xie, Founder of Fortinet] Video about [http://www.fortinet.com/videos/fortios-43-monitoring.html FortiOS 4.3] Monitoring, includes IP address, Location, Identity.

"Further, '''all surfing actions can also be logged and analyzed. Users’ surfing habits can be monitored and thus filtering fine-tuned. If the FortiGate unit has an integrated storage module – internal hard disk or AMC module, or you use a FortiAnalyzer unit, you can log the web sites visited and generate reports to see what the web site flow is, and even, who the top users are''', and adjust your network web filtering policies accordingly to strike a balance of network traffic management."

'''FortiDB''' supports options for data collection such as network protocol agents and a network sniffer.

NetScreen (NASDAQ: NSCN) later was acquired by Juniper (NASDAQ: JNPR) for $4 billion.

Fortinet completed its IPO (NASDAQ: FTNT), which was lauded by Renaissance Capital as "2009 IPO of the Year."

| Carl Windsor
| Major Accounts Manager in the UK

After several years experience working for in the teleco environment he moved into datacenter hosting as Service Delivery Manager and was one of the first Fortinet Managed Security Service Providers. Carl has been working for Fortinet for over four years and is currently a Major Accounts Manager in the UK.
