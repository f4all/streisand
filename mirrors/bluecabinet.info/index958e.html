<p>AXE is an acronym for Automatic Cross-Connection Equipment.
</p><p>The AXE is the digital successor to the AKE analogue telephone exchange and ARF/ARM family of crossbar switches. The design is modular with an APZ dual processor running in sync mode, an APT switching part and an APG I/O part. It is used for connecting local landlines, operate mobile networks (TDMA, GSM, CDMA, W-CDMA, PDC), international telephony traffic and signaling.
</p><p>Developed in 1974 by <b>Ellemtel</b>, a research and development subsidiary of Ericsson and Televerket, the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AXE_telephone_exchange">AXE telephone exchange</a> line of circuit switched digital telephone exchanges manufactured by Ericsson that was used in 1976. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ericsson.com/ourportfolio/products/axe-enabler-1.0?nav=fgb_101_506%7Cfgb_101_095">AXE Enabler 1.0</a> for fixed circuit-switched networks... is implemented in all network layers (local and transit exchanges, international gateways, signaling transfer points, service switching points and operator exchanges), enabling a single application system for the complete TDM network.

<ul>
<li> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ericsson.com/hr/services/competence/course_axe/LZU_108_5933_en.pdf">AXE Enabler 1.0</a> includes the latest hardware generation, AXE 810. Ericsson's AXE has been deployed in 145 countries, supporting 180 million lines, distributed over 6000 exchanges.</b>

<p><b>AXE Enabler 1.0 is being used by Syrian Telecom</b>

</p><p>"AXE based equipment are being used as BSC/TRC, MSC, HLR, SCP, FNR, TSC and wireline nodes.
</p><p>The brain of the AXE system is a dual processor system called APZ. It runs in parallel sync mode making it fault redundant. The family of APZs started with APZ 210 03 in 1976; the latest one is APZ 212 60. The parallel sync mode was partly abandoned in the APZ 212 40 and subsequent models and has been replaced with a warm standby scheme.
</p><p>The latest APZ type is 214 03 which is use as MSC, TSC and HLR Blade in AXE. The latest implementation of AXE is on a blade cluster system capable of handling up to 8 million subscribers.
</p><p>The core of the switching part was the Group Switch, initially a time-space-time multiplexer capable of switching up to 64K positions or connections. This Group Switch later evolved to a Distributed Group Switch using Time-Space switching technique with a maximum capacity of 512K.
</p><p>AXE nodes have evolved as a traffic controller, having the new Media Gateway node running on CPP platform handle the payload traffic.
</p><p><b>Ericsson AXE telephone exchanges support lawful intercepts via the remote-control equipment subsystem (RES), which carries out the tap, and the interception management system (IMS), software used for initiating the tap, which adds the tap to the RES database. In a fully operating lawful interception system the RES and IMS both create logs of all numbers being tapped so that system administrators can perform audits to find unauthorized taps.</b>
</p><p><b>Code is written in PLEX (a proprietary language tied to the AXE hardware, designed by Göran Hemdahl),[2] SDL and ASA210C programming languages. Code for Regional Processors (controlling hardware Extension Modules) is written in ASA210R.</b> "
