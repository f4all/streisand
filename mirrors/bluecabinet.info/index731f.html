=== Background ===

SPECIAL NOTE:

SAP has been included in Blue cabinet, due making customized products, partnering with the company '''NetApp''' [known to be used by the Syrian govt.], '''Cisco''' and other companies known for surveillance products i.e. Deep Packet Inspection, Interception, Filtering, Tracking. These companies work with SAP in R&amp;D - '''[http://www.sap.com/partners/COIL/index.epx SAP Partners GLOBAL SAP CO-INNOVATION LAB (COIL) NETWORK]''' Switzerland. * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEnT4o8trIw&amp;feature=relmfu INTEL VP, Data Center Group] explains why collaborating with SAP is a "Game Changer"

In addition, Blue cabinet has concerns over BIG DATA, Data`Rentention and Data Centers that are acquiring and collecting personal data. Whether for surveillance, identifying dissidents, activists or for other more acceptable reasons i.e. Climate/Weather -- it appears that some of the SAP products, when integrated with non-SAP products used for Deep Packet Inspection, Data Mining, Data Rentention and Data Analysis, contribute towards greater surveillance abilities in time and storage. 

'''Not all Blue cabinet/BSRE contributors are convinced that SAP belongs in the wiki.''' At this time it is unknown what "custom" products SAP and integration has been used for surveillance or censorship.

The desktop edition of '''SAP BusinessObjects Interactive Analysis software''' is designed to provide ad-hoc query and analysis functions in a self-service environment for data-savvy business professionals. An interface enables customers to combine various types of data from different sources into interactive documents, and helps them uncover shareable answers to spontaneous and iterative business questions.

'''SAP BusinessObjects BI solutions''' are available in both on-demand and on-premise deployment options. They include a business intelligence platform with integrated services that are back-end, not user-facing. Integrated platform services include security (who can access the system and what information they can see), load balancing (plug in extra servers, and work is shared across them), and scheduling (refresh reports during the night when system usage is low). The BI solutions also enable users to interact with business information and answer ad hoc questions without advanced knowledge of the underlying data sources and structures. They can help customers '''access data across various sources and formats and deliver it as consumable information inside and outside the organization'''. Customers can use these tools to uncover trends and patterns and solve business problems, to anticipate business changes, and to help reach organizational goals. Customers can also use BI solutions to support their forecasting of future business conditions, to '''track and analyze''' key business metrics via '''dashboards, to interact with visual representations of information'''. Self-service access enables business users to '''create reports and perform analyses themselves without depending on their IT support'''. 

'''SAP BusinessObjects IM solutions''' provide functions for data integration, data quality management, and metadata management — working with functions in the SAP NetWeaver technology platform, such as data warehousing, master data management, and information life-cycle management to help build a data foundation that offers agile support for business or IT initiatives. The solutions help enable information management in both SAP and non-SAP software environments. Customers can access, profile, integrate, transform, move, or cleanse structured or unstructured data.

SAP BusinessObjects EPM solutions are optimized for both SAP and non-SAP environments, across multiple lines of business, including finance, the supply chain and procurement, and they include solutions for strategy management; planning, budgeting and forecasting; financial consolidation; and profitability and cost management. 

The solutions are integrated with SAP BusinessObjects BI solutions and SAP BusinessObjects GRC solutions to further help companies close the gap between strategy and execution.
