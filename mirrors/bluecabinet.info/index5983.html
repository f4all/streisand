</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonesaw is a “cyber targeting application” that tracks servers and routers worldwide, mapping the hardware attached to the Web.
These are the access points through which the National Security Agency, Cyber Command and other U.S. agencies, could launch operations against adversaries and threats... 
</p><p>Endgame’s Bonesaw is marketed to U.S. intelligence agencies and large companies. It doesn’t hide its offensive capabilities as a tool for launching cyber weapons.
</p><p>Marketing documents say “the Bonesaw platform provides a complete environment for intelligence analysts and mission planners to take a holistic approach to target discovery, reducing the time to create actionable intelligence and operational plans from days to minutes.”
</p><p>“Bonesaw is the ability to map, basically every device connected to the Internet and what hardware and software it is,” says a company official who requested anonymity. The official points out that the firm doesn’t launch offensive cyber ops, it just helps."
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://cptnatefick.tumblr.com/post/40628627630/nathaniel-fick-former-cnas-chief-heads-cyber">Nate Fick, Endgame Systems CEO</a>
</p><p>" The Bonesaw platform provides a complete environment for intelligence analysts and mission planners to take a <b>holistic approach to target discovery</b> – reducing the time to create <b>actionable intelligence</b> and operation plans from days to minutes.  Analysts of all experience levels can deploy and quickly use <b>Bonesaw to aggregate data from disparate sources and formats into a single intuitive user interface</b>." <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://alamoace.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=76">[4]</a>
</p><p>"Bonesaw, the map displays the geolocation and digital address of basically every device connected to the Internet around the world, providing what’s called network situational awareness. The client locates a region on the password-protected web-based map, then picks a country and city— say, Beijing, China. Next the client types in the name of the target organization, such as the Ministry of Public Security’s No. 3 Research Institute, which is responsible for computer security—or simply enters its address, 6 Zhengyi Road. The map will then display what software is running on the computers inside the facility, what types of malware some may contain, and a menu of custom-designed exploits that can be used to secretly gain entry. It can also pinpoint those devices infected with malware, such as the Conficker worm, as well as networks turned into botnets and zombies— the equivalent of a back door left open.
</p><p>Bonesaw also contains targeting data on US allies, and it is soon to be upgraded with a new version codenamed Velocity, according to C4ISR Journal. It will allow Endgame’s clients to observe in real time as hardware and software connected to the Internet around the world is added, removed, or changed. But such access doesn’t come cheap. One leaked report indicated that annual subscriptions could run as high as $2.5 million for 25 zero-day exploits.
</p><p>The buying and using of such a subscription by nation-states could be seen as an act of war. “If you are engaged in reconnaissance on an adversary’s systems, you are laying the electronic battlefield and preparing to use it,” wrote Mike Jacobs, a former NSA director for information assurance, in a McAfee report on cyberwarfare. “In my opinion, these activities constitute acts of war, or at least a prelude to future acts of war.” The question is, who else is on the secretive company’s client list? Because there is as of yet no oversight or regulation of the cyberweapons trade, companies in the cyber-industrial complex are free to sell to whomever they wish. “It should be illegal,” says the former senior intelligence official involved in cyber­warfare. “I knew about Endgame when I was in intelligence. The intelligence community didn’t like it, but they’re the largest consumer of that business.” Source: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/06/general-keith-alexander-cyberwar/all/">Wired</a>
