</p><p>"Net Optics, Inc., the leading provider of Intelligent Access and Monitoring Architecture solutions delivering real-time IT visibility, monitoring and control; and RDT Equipment and Systems, a supplier at the forefront of Automatic Testing Equipment, Communications, Test &amp; Measurement and Wireless &amp; RF, will host a seminar in Tel Aviv, Israel, to address business and technology aspects of Network Intelligence. 
</p><p>At the seminar, Sharon Besser, Net Optics Vice President of Technology, will discuss how Network Intelligence enables companies to gain visibility in virtual and physical environments for improving management, security and compliance.
</p><p>Network Intelligence—Vital to Next-Generation Networks
</p><p>Network Intelligence is an overarching technology that builds on the concepts and capabilities of <b>network monitoring, Packet Capture, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)</b> and Business Intelligence (BI). Network Intelligence enables an organization to <b>closely examine the volumes of IP data</b> that cross communications networks. This is accomplished by <b>identifying the protocol elements used and extracting packet conten</b>t and metadata for analysis of data relationships and <b>communications patterns</b>. 
</p><p>Network Intelligence Delivers the Benefits of Monitoring Technology Progress
</p><p>Network Intelligence is used to capture and feed information to a host of monitoring tools, support security and compliance, and carry out network management and instrumentation, as well as for bandwidth management, traffic shaping, policy management, and <b>lawful interception activities</b>. Currently, Network Intelligence is being incorporated into a wide range of applications by vendors who provide technology solutions to enterprises, Communications Service Providers (CSPs), <b>governments</b> and  Small-to-Medium Businesses (SMBs)."
