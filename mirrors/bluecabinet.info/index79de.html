</p><p><b>Data Collection</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://blogs.cisco.com/security/correlating-netflow-data-for-proactive-security-network-notoriety/">NetFlow</a>blog by Mike Schiffman
</li>
</ul>
<p>"NetFlow is a UDP-exported network profiling protocol originally developed by Cisco Systems in 1996. It enables participating devices (typically routers and switches) to report telemetry data on the network traffic flowing through them (such a device is called a NetFlow exporter). This data is sent to a downstream machine, called a NetFlow Collector: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://blogs.cisco.com/wp-content/uploads/NF02-1.jpg">see Diagram</a>...
<b>[ NetFlow version 9]</b> introduced much more power with the <b>capability to dynamically change the packet format</b> using templates and match on just about anything using Flexible NetFlow.
</p><p><b>If packet capture can be thought of as a wiretap, NetFlow can be considered the phone bill.</b> NetFlow allows the Network Administrator and Security Practitioner to determine:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Who is talking to who</b>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <b>Over what ports (or protocols)</b>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <b>For how long</b>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <b>At what speed</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Data Mining</b> for Misuse: NetFlow flows, when aggregated, can provide an excellent target for data mining. Suspicious, unusual, or even illegal behaviors can be tracked and trended.
</p><p><br />
<b>Products and Services</b> 
</p><p>The company’s product offerings fall into the following categories: its core technologies, 
</p><p>Routing and Switching;
