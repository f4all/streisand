=== Background ===

"Procera Networks, Inc. (PKT:NASDAQ GM) provides intelligent policy enforcement (IPE) solutions that enable mobile and broadband network operators and entities managing private networks, including higher education institutions, businesses, and government entities (collectively referred to as network operators) to gain improved visibility into, and control of, their networks. 

The company’s solutions provide granular '''network intelligence''' intended to enable network operators to improve the quality and longevity of their networks, monetize their network infrastructure investments, control security hazards and create, commercialize and deploy new applications and services for their users. 

The company’s products are '''marketed under the PacketLogic brand name'''. It sells its products through its direct sales force, resellers, distributors, '''and systems integrators''' in the Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe. The company has its sales office in Japan. 

* '''Customers'''
'''The company sells its products and solutions both directly and indirectly to its end-customers'''. 

As of December 31, 2011, it had approximately '''600 customers throughout North America, Europe, and Asia'''. Its customers include '''mobile and broadband network operators'''. 

'''Broadband network operators include telecommunications companies and private network operators'''. Its customers either serve subscriber customers or operate private networks, such as a university campus, or enterprise '''or government agency networks'''. 

Its network operator customers include mobile service providers, broadband service providers, cable multiple system operators, Internet service providers, educational institutions, enterprises, '''and government agencies'''. 

The company’s '''major customers include Shaw Communications, Inc. and Jet Infosystems'''. 


* '''Research and Development''' 
The company’s research and development costs were $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. 


* '''Competition''' 
The company’s primary competitors include '''Allot Communications Ltd.; Arbor Networks (acquired by Tektronix); Blue Coat Systems; Cisco Systems, Inc.; Cloudshield Technologies (acquired by SAIC); Brocade Communications Systems; Juniper Networks; and Sandvine Corporation'''. It also competes with '''Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, Huawei Technologies Company, and Nokia Siemens'''.

=== Products ===

* '''Product Lines''' 

The company’s '''IPE solutions''' are powered by its three primary product lines: 

'''PacketLogic Subscriber Manager (PSM)'''
 
The PSM '''integrates PacketLogic with network management and operation systems, including AAA, OSS, BSS, provisioning and policy managers'''. This integration enables policy enforcement, '''per-user tracking''', also known as user awareness, as well as '''knowledge of where in the network the user connects (location awareness)'''. User awareness could be utilized to create personalized offerings for new customers through value-add services. Location awareness makes it possible to resolve, or even avoid, congestion, improving the user-experience. It could also control roaming costs through automatic policy enforcement. 


'''PacketLogic Intelligence Center (PIC)'''

PIC with PacketLogic Report Studio provides the visualization of the application and subscriber intelligence gathered by deployed PacketLogic systems. Utilizing the subscriber and location awareness provided by the PSM and the application intelligence provided by the PacketLogic Real-Time Enforcement Platform (PRE), the '''PIC is able to present a wealth of information to the network operator''' based on the behavior of their network. The PIC gives network managers access to relevant network traffic intelligence that enables network optimization, creation of appealing services, and protection against malicious behavior. 


'''PRE'''
 
'''PRE utilizes multiple hardware platforms that run the same operating software''' offering high performance and capacity. Each of the platforms offers features enabled through the different PacketLogic software modules, including '''LiveView, Filtering''', Traffic Shaping, and Statistics. 

The '''PacketLogic hardware platforms''' offer a range of configurations from the entry-level 4 Mbps PL5600 through 2 Gbps PL7720. The mid-range PL8720 is a 2RU unit with up to 10Gbps throughput. 

The company’s '''ATCA chassis solutions''' include the PL10000 series with capacity up to 120Gbps and 10 million subscribers per system in addition to the PL20000 with capacity up to 320Gbps and 10 million subscribers. 


* '''Global Services''' 
The company’s products and solutions are supported by its suite of services that include both pre- and post-sales technical support to its direct field sales organization, channel partners and customers; 

professional services for planning, implementation and deployment; 

customer services for support post-deployment; 

training for its customers for use of its IPE products and solutions; 

and consulting services to assist in all service phases from initial planning and evaluation to onsite testing and operation.
