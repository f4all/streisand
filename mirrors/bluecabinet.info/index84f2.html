=== Products ===

* INTRACOM [http://tinyurl.com/cm5kxv4 Thessaloniki, Greece facility] is for development of the '''ERICSSON AXE switch (INTERCEPT)'''

* Wiretapping Switch '''AXE'''

AXE is an acronym for Automatic Cross-Connection Equipment.

The AXE is the digital successor to the AKE analogue telephone exchange and ARF/ARM family of crossbar switches. The design is modular with an APZ dual processor running in sync mode, an APT switching part and an APG I/O part. It is used for connecting local landlines, operate mobile networks (TDMA, GSM, CDMA, W-CDMA, PDC), international telephony traffic and signaling.

Developed in 1974 by '''Ellemtel''', a research and development subsidiary of Ericsson and Televerket, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AXE_telephone_exchange AXE telephone exchange] line of circuit switched digital telephone exchanges manufactured by Ericsson that was used in 1976. [http://www.ericsson.com/ourportfolio/products/axe-enabler-1.0?nav=fgb_101_506|fgb_101_095 AXE Enabler 1.0] for fixed circuit-switched networks... is implemented in all network layers (local and transit exchanges, international gateways, signaling transfer points, service switching points and operator exchanges), enabling a single application system for the complete TDM network. 

* '''[http://www.ericsson.com/hr/services/competence/course_axe/LZU_108_5933_en.pdf AXE Enabler 1.0] includes the latest hardware generation, AXE 810. Ericsson's AXE has been deployed in 145 countries, supporting 180 million lines, distributed over 6000 exchanges.

'''AXE Enabler 1.0 is being used by Syrian Telecom'''

see more on AXE on [http://www.scribd.com/doc/51656971/AxeServer Scribed]

"AXE based equipment are being used as BSC/TRC, MSC, HLR, SCP, FNR, TSC and wireline nodes.

The brain of the AXE system is a dual processor system called APZ. It runs in parallel sync mode making it fault redundant. The family of APZs started with APZ 210 03 in 1976; the latest one is APZ 212 60. The parallel sync mode was partly abandoned in the APZ 212 40 and subsequent models and has been replaced with a warm standby scheme.

The latest APZ type is 214 03 which is use as MSC, TSC and HLR Blade in AXE. The latest implementation of AXE is on a blade cluster system capable of handling up to 8 million subscribers.

The core of the switching part was the Group Switch, initially a time-space-time multiplexer capable of switching up to 64K positions or connections. This Group Switch later evolved to a Distributed Group Switch using Time-Space switching technique with a maximum capacity of 512K.

AXE nodes have evolved as a traffic controller, having the new Media Gateway node running on CPP platform handle the payload traffic.

'''Ericsson AXE telephone exchanges support lawful intercepts via the remote-control equipment subsystem (RES), which carries out the tap, and the interception management system (IMS), software used for initiating the tap, which adds the tap to the RES database. In a fully operating lawful interception system the RES and IMS both create logs of all numbers being tapped so that system administrators can perform audits to find unauthorized taps.'''

'''Code is written in PLEX (a proprietary language tied to the AXE hardware, designed by G√∂ran Hemdahl),[2] SDL and ASA210C programming languages. Code for Regional Processors (controlling hardware Extension Modules) is written in ASA210R.''' "
