</p><p>The company’s segments include RF Communications, Integrated Network Solutions, and Government Communications Systems. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>RF Communications:</b> 
</li>
</ul>
<p>This segment consists of the U.S. Department of Defense and International Tactical Communications and Public Safety and Professional Communications. This segment supplies secure tactical radio communications and embedded encryption solutions for military, government, and commercial organizations and also of secure communications systems and equipment for public safety, utility, and transportation markets. 
</p><p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>U.S. Department of Defense and International Tactical Communications:</b> 
</li>
</ul>
<p>The company designs, develops, and manufactures a line of secure radio communications products and systems for manpack, handheld, soldier-worn, vehicular, strategic fixed-site and shipboard applications that operate in various radio frequency bands — high-frequency (HF), very high-frequency (VHF) and ultra high-frequency (UHF), as well as in multiband mode and over satellite communications (SATCOM). 
</p><p>The company’s <b>Falcon family of tactical radios is built on a software-defined radio platform that is reprogrammable to add features or software upgrades</b>. 
</p><p>The company’s <b>Falcon III family of radios</b> is the next generation of multiband, multi-mission tactical radios supporting the U.S. military’s Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) requirements, as well as network-centric operations worldwide. The company’s Falcon III multiband manpack radio, the <b>AN/PRC-117G (117G)</b>, is the JTRS Software Communications Architecture (SCA)-certified and National Security Agency (NSA) Type-1 certified manpack radio system providing wideband networking capability, enabling the transition to a networked battlefield communications environment and high-bandwidth applications, including streaming video, simultaneous voice and data feeds, intelligence reporting and analysis, collaborative chat, route planning, convoy tracking, checkpoint biometrics and connectivity to secure networks (SIPRNet). 
</p><p>The 117G uses the Harris-developed Adaptive Networking Wideband Waveform (ANW2) for high bandwidth data operation and is designed for upgrade to the JTRS Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW). The 117G’s wideband network access capabilities give warfighters and field commanders critical real-time information. The 117G has been deployed to all branches of the DoD and is being used in various ground, vehicular and airborne applications, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR). The 117G includes a Remote Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER) interoperable mode that provides warfighters on the battlefield with the ability to receive live video directly from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This capability allows users to receive video feeds directly from UAVs without an intermediary or having to pass that information from a base station.
