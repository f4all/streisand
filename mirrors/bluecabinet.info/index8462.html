=== Background ===

Prolexic has a global, cloud-based network protection service that includes staff to mitigate and counter DDoS attacks, including using forensics.

"typical DDoS mitigation time is just 1-5 minutes after traffic starts flowing through Prolexic’s scrubbing centers. The "network of DDoS scrubbing centers are located in London, Hong Kong, San Jose, California and Ashburn, Virginia"

"Our DDoS scrubbing centers are supported by four Tier 1 global telecommunications carriers. Unlike other DDoS mitigation providers, we don’t piggyback other services such as DNS on our DDoS mitigation network. So what does this mean? It means we can mitigate the largest DDoS attacks launched in the world – the high packet-per-second DDoS floods that bring down sites, and low and slow encrypted Layer 7 attacks that cripple applications. And this is really important – because of this immense anti-DDoS bandwidth, it means that we can provide DDoS protection services for multiple clients and fight multiple DDoS attacks at once.

When a DDoS attack is detected, our DDoS protection services are implemented within minutes. Upon activation of DDoS protection, a Prolexic customer routes in-bound traffic to the nearest Prolexic scrubbing center, where proprietary DDoS filtering techniques, advanced routing, and patent-pending anti-DoS hardware devices remove DDoS traffic close to the source of the botnet activity. Clean traffic is then routed back to the customer’s network.

Because we dedicate more bandwidth to DDoS denial of service attack traffic than any other provider – supplemented by proprietary tools, techniques, and experienced security experts – we can protect your site(s) against even the largest and most complex DDoS attacks. Where other DDoS mitigation providers rely on 3 or 4 technologies and anti-DDoS techniques to monitor and mitigate denial of service attacks, Prolexic uses over 20 DDoS mitigation technologies – many of them proprietary.

Prolexic mitigates every type of DDoS attack at every layer including Layer 3, 4, and 7. We even have a proven solution against encrypted attacks that vandalize HTTPS traffic in real time. Further, we use certified FIPS-140-2 Level 3 key management encryption tools with passive SSL decryption for extremely high performance. Often DDoS attackers who see traffic has been re-routed through our DDoS mitigation network immediately abandon their attacks – they know they do not have the capacity to overcome Prolexic."
