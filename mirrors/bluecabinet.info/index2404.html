'''L3 Communications''' - http://www.l-3com.com/

'''Get Engineering''' - http://www.getntds.com/

ONPATH Technologies Inc. and G.E.T. POWER Pvt. Ltd. (GET Engineering) are deploying cost savings solutions for the United States Navy. The Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) is a tactical information processing protocol designed by the Navy to automate the collection of combat information data such as positioning of aircraft, ships, and submarine targets, as well as navigational information into an overall tactical picture. This vital communications link is one of the core interfaces of the Aegis weapons targeting system. GET's MIL-STD-1397 NTDS to Fiber Optic Converters are used by Naval Test and Training facilities to provide an interface that converts deterministic NTDS signals traveling through bulky, expensive copper cables into signals that can then travel on smaller, lighter fiber optic cables. GET's converters are enabling the Navy to reduce the volume of copper cables used for transferring critical tactical and navigation data, while also enabling communication signals to be transmitted over longer distances. Power and cooling requirements are greatly reduced. ONPATH's Universal Connectivity System (UCS), including its HorizON(TM) Software, is a high performance connectivity and monitoring solution that is speed and protocol agnostic across a range of less than 1 Mbit per second to over 100 Gbits per second. It therefore delivers an advanced platform to automate moves and changes of NTDS and Fiber Optic connections in order to help network managers conserve time, increase utilization, and save money compared to manual patching or complex switching architectures. The UCS platform is providing the switching component for GET's NTDS to Fiber Converters being utilized by the Navy. In addition to the U.S. Navy, ONPATH provides solutions to other Government agencies, including the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force, as well as Fortune 1,000 companies. Because of the compact size and extremely dense port count of ONPATH's new UCS 3900 platform, it is now deployable directly onboard ships. The 3900 will provide the ability to connect tactical targeting sensors and navigational data to weapons platforms in order to provide critical situational awareness.

'''Simena, LLC'''

ONPATH Technologies Inc. and Simena, LLC announced a strategic partnership to add the lowest latency aggregation, filtering, and monitoring switch, the Simena Packet Flow Switch (PFS) into ONPATH's UCS suite. The PFS employs Layer 2-4 technology to aggregate, filter, disseminate, and load-balance network traffic to a variety of devices, including monitoring, measurement, and security tools. The PFS enables customers to optimize the performance and investment of these expensive tools, while allowing network managers to reduce cost by centralizing operations, monitoring services, and enhancing network security. Designed to help users increase productivity in monitoring and troubleshooting, the PFS provides flexibility with test configurations through the use of existing network tools, while saving valuable SPAN ports on switches. The Packet Flow Switch delivers such advanced features as, aggregation of several traffic streams to a single network tool; packet filtering to enable users to pick and choose specific packets to be forwarded, packet slicing to enable users to forward only the configurable portions of a packet, increasing throughput and maximizing the performance of attached monitoring systems, Port Tagging to mark packets with the port IDs where they are received, enabling the identification of packet origins, and scaling up to 100,000 ports when used in conjunction with the UCS. In addition, the PFS provides the ability to run all of these advanced features at full wire speed, without impacting performance, to provide unprecedented flexibility and complete control in forwarding packets with an unlimited number of connectivity options. With the addition of the Simena's PFS to ONPATH's Physical Layer product suite, the UCS is now expanded to provide the industry's most complete Layer 1 through 4 connectivity and monitoring solution across Enterprise and Federal applications. With speed- and protocol-independent connectivity ranging from RS-232 to 100Gbps and beyond, including standard protocols such as Ethernet, Fiber Channel, and SONET, as well as proprietary protocols, the ONPATH solution provides monitoring of performance and security applications across virtually any network infrastructure. ONPATH enables customers to increase their overall network security, reliability, and performance; increase the utilization of existing data center, monitoring, and security tools; monitor more with less budget and personnel; simplify the operation of their network; manage change more quickly; and adhere to compliance mandates.
