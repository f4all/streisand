"World Surveillance Group Inc. designs, develops, markets, and sells autonomous lighter-than-air (LTA) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) worldwide. Its products would carry payloads that provide security and/or wireless communications from air to ground solutions at various altitudes. 

The company’s airships,''' when integrated with electronics systems and other technology payloads''', are designed for use by government-related and commercial entities that require '''real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance or communications support''' for military, homeland defense, border control, drug interdiction, natural disaster relief, and maritime missions. 

Its business focuses primarily on the design and development of UAVs that provide situational awareness and other communications capabilities through the integration of wireless capabilities and customer payloads. The company unveiled its mid-altitude LTA UAV, the '''Argus One''', which represents a new airship design and is equipped with its stabilization system that autonomously controls the level of rigidity of the airship in flight and an integrated payload bay capable of initially '''carrying approximately 30 pounds of high technology sensors, cameras or electronics package'''s. Argus One is an unmanned autonomous airship with automated control for individual body modules for improved flight stability and aerodynamic control. The Argus One can wirelessly transmit critical live video and other information generated by its payload of electro-optical or infrared sensors, cameras or other high technology electronics directly to a ground control station or system.

The company also focuses on the development of a mid-altitude airship that features a semi-rigid, cigar based, non-modulating design which it calls the SkySat. The SkySat airship is a traditional airship design and is designed to carry heavier payloads for longer durations. It also offers the Stratellite, which is a high altitude airship.
