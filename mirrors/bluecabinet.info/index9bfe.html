=== Background ===

"SevOne, Inc. is venture funded and backed by a group of private investors, each with long and successful backgrounds in business and technology."

"SevOne Inc. provides a network performance management solution that delivers fast, scalable, and comprehensive real-time monitoring, troubleshooting and performance reporting solution to ensure application performance and reliability. The '''SevOne Performance Appliance Solution''' (SevOne PAS) and '''SevOne Distributed NetFlow Collector''' (SevOne DNC) enable IT organizations to keep increasingly complex networks, servers and applications functioning at peak performance levels." [http://www.crunchbase.com/company/sevone CrunchBase]

=== Products ===

* '''[http://www.sevone.com/technologies/flow-analysis SevOne Dedicated NetFlow Collector] (DNC)''' - take full advantage of valuable Flow data for use in network and application performance management. Our DNC leverages the same architecture and design principles used in other SevOne appliances to create the industry’s most comprehensive, scalable and affordable solution for Flow collection and reporting.

* '''[http://www.sevone.com/technologies/architecture SevOne Cluster™]''' technology allows you to grow your '''data collection infinitely'''.

Unique Capabilities:

'''Complete and Instant Visibility'''

Enables visibility into legacy networks, virtualized environments, cloud networks, voice/data/video networks and flow data — all from a single, unified console and reporting engine.

'''Immediate access to both real-time data as well as up to a year of raw data''' allows engineers to drill into the past with the same granularity as the present.

'''Accuracy-at-Scale Collection'''

300 polling threads per appliance ensures that data is collected at the scheduled times and that no gaps in visibility occur as collection needs scale.

'''Speed-at-Scale Reporting'''

'''Eliminates the scalability bottleneck''' of a centralized reporting server by utilizing the reporting capabilities of all peered appliances, resulting in network-wide reports that take seconds, not hours.

'''Proven "Big Data" Deployments'''

Numerous customers that manage millions of network elements and run baseline '''analytics in the trillions have access to the results''' in a single easy-to-use web interface

Return On Investment (ROI)

The “All-in-One” appliance (collection, storage and reporting) and its powerful capabilities involve a much smaller solution footprint, need less daily management, and are easy to use — resulting in improvements in CAPEX/OPEX expenses.
