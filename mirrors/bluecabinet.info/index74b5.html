** Significant Events:

In November 2011, '''AT&amp;T, Inc. and Harris Corp. are forming an alliance''' to develop and deliver next generation LTE wireless solutions for agencies and first responders whose lifesaving efforts depend on timely access to critical information. " 


As of July 1 2011, the company was awarded various '''new contracts and follow-on contracts under classified programs'''. 

+ It also were awarded a 30-month contract by '''Sierra Nevada Corporation''' to design, build, and integrate the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite payload as part of '''NASA’s Rapid Response Space Works and Modular Space Vehicles''' program; 

+ a three-year contract from '''Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems''' to build Ka-band antennas for 3 Inmarsat-5 satellites; and 

+ a 3 year contract from Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems for a 22-meter deployable L-band reflector to support military and civil communications in '''Mexico'''. 


Acquisitions:

+ In July 2010, the company acquired Privately held '''CapRock Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries''', including CapRock Communications, Inc. (collectively, CapRock), a global provider of managed satellite communications services for the government, energy and maritime industries. CapRock’s solutions include broadband Internet access, voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) telephony, wideband networking and real-time video, delivered to approximately 2,000 customer sites worldwide. 


+ In 2011, the company acquired from Schlumberger B.V. and its affiliates (Schlumberger) '''the assets of the Schlumberger group’s Global Connectivity Services business (Schlumberger GCS)''', a provider of satellite and terrestrial communications services for the worldwide energy industry.

Carefx’s solution suite is used by approximately 800 hospitals, healthcare systems and health information exchanges across '''North America, Europe and Asia'''. 



Segments 

The company’s segments include RF Communications, Integrated Network Solutions, and Government Communications Systems. 

* '''RF Communications:''' 

This segment consists of the U.S. Department of Defense and International Tactical Communications and Public Safety and Professional Communications. This segment supplies secure tactical radio communications and embedded encryption solutions for military, government, and commercial organizations and also of secure communications systems and equipment for public safety, utility, and transportation markets. 


* '''U.S. Department of Defense and International Tactical Communications:''' 

The company designs, develops, and manufactures a line of secure radio communications products and systems for manpack, handheld, soldier-worn, vehicular, strategic fixed-site and shipboard applications that operate in various radio frequency bands — high-frequency (HF), very high-frequency (VHF) and ultra high-frequency (UHF), as well as in multiband mode and over satellite communications (SATCOM). 

The company’s '''Falcon family of tactical radios is built on a software-defined radio platform that is reprogrammable to add features or software upgrades'''. 

The company’s '''Falcon III family of radios''' is the next generation of multiband, multi-mission tactical radios supporting the U.S. military’s Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) requirements, as well as network-centric operations worldwide. The company’s Falcon III multiband manpack radio, the '''AN/PRC-117G (117G)''', is the JTRS Software Communications Architecture (SCA)-certified and National Security Agency (NSA) Type-1 certified manpack radio system providing wideband networking capability, enabling the transition to a networked battlefield communications environment and high-bandwidth applications, including streaming video, simultaneous voice and data feeds, intelligence reporting and analysis, collaborative chat, route planning, convoy tracking, checkpoint biometrics and connectivity to secure networks (SIPRNet). 

The 117G uses the Harris-developed Adaptive Networking Wideband Waveform (ANW2) for high bandwidth data operation and is designed for upgrade to the JTRS Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW). The 117G’s wideband network access capabilities give warfighters and field commanders critical real-time information. The 117G has been deployed to all branches of the DoD and is being used in various ground, vehicular and airborne applications, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR). The 117G includes a Remote Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER) interoperable mode that provides warfighters on the battlefield with the ability to receive live video directly from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This capability allows users to receive video feeds directly from UAVs without an intermediary or having to pass that information from a base station. 


** '''The company’s cryptographic solutions encompass NSA-certified products and systems''' that range from single integrated circuits to major communications systems, including its Sierra and Citadel embedded encryption solutions and KGV-72 blue force tracking programmable encryption devices and its SecNet 11 and SecNet 54 Internet Protocol (IP) communications families of communications security (COMSEC) terminals.
