=== Background ===
Publicly traded with IPO NASDAQ: VRNT

VERINT was formerly '''Comverse Infosys''' and is one of the numerous subsidiaries of [http://bluecabinet.info/wiki/Blue_cabinet/Comverse COMVERSE TECHNOLOGIES]

* August 2012 : Verint acquired Comverse Technologies stock to spinoff new company '''Comverse Inc.''' [http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-08-13/verint-systems-buying-comverse-technology Businessweek] See also jpg [http://t.co/I46T5LG9 assets reported] (pg 8)

The Company has several subsidery companies that are surveillance vendors including;

* '''INEO'' that sells [http://www.syborg.de/index_en.html SYBORG surveillance technology] A German based company selling GSM interception systems, tapping and monitoring.

* May 2007: Verint acquired '''Witness''' 

'''Verint is a global leader in '''Actionable Intelligence solutions'''. 

* The Verint '''Communications and Cyber Intelligence''' Solutions  readily handles vast amounts of data from a wide variety of sources. 
The portfolio includes:  

'''Communications interception'''

'''Cyber intelligence'''

'''Mobile location tracking'''

'''Open Source Web Intelligence'''

'''Tactical communications intelligence'''

" '''Law enforcement, national security, intelligence, and government agencies can deploy these solutions alone or together, as part of a large-scale system designed to generate evidence and intelligence and promote more efficient, productive investigations'''. "

" In the security intelligence market, Verint’s '''Video Intelligence''', public safety, and '''Communications Intelligence''' solutions are '''vital to government'''... 

Verint supports its customers '''around the globe''' directly and with '''an extensive network of selling and support partners'''.

''Verint’s Business''

Verint serves two markets through three product lines. Verint’s Workforce Optimization product line serves the enterprise workforce optimization market, while its Video Intelligence and Communications Intelligence product lines serve the security intelligence market.

'''Verint is a leading provider of enterprise workforce optimization software and services'''. Verint’s solutions enable organizations to extract and analyze valuable information from customer interactions and related operational data in order to make more effective, proactive decisions for optimizing the performance of their customer service operations, improving the customer experience, and enhancing compliance. Key business and technology trends driving these solutions include a growing interest in a unified workforce optimization suite and sophisticated customer interaction analytics, the adoption of workforce optimization solutions outside contact centers, and the ongoing upgrade of traditional time-division multiplexing (or TDM) voice systems to VoIP telephony infrastructure. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, revenue from Workforce Optimization solutions represented approximately 53%, 53% and 49% of Verint’s total revenue, respectively.

Verint is a leading provider of networked IP video solutions designed to optimize security and enhance operations. Verint’s Video Intelligence solutions portfolio includes IP video management software and services, edge devices for capturing, digitizing, and transmitting video over different types of wired and wireless networks, video analytics, and networked DVRs. Key business and technology trends in the Video Intelligence solutions include increased demand for advanced security solutions due to ongoing terrorism and security threats around the world and the transition from relatively passive analog CCTV video systems to more sophisticated network-based IP video solutions. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 revenue from Video Intelligence solutions represented approximately 21%, 19% and 28% of Verint’s total revenue, respectively.

Verint is also a leading provider of communications intelligence and investigative solutions that help law enforcement, national security, intelligence, and civilian government agencies effectively detect, investigate, and neutralize criminal and terrorist threats. Verint’s solutions are designed to handle massive amounts of unstructured and structured information from different sources, quickly make sense of complex scenarios, and generate evidence and intelligence. 


Key business and technology trends in these solutions include the demand for innovative communications intelligence and investigative solutions due to terrorism, criminal activities, and other security threats, an expanding range of communication and information media, the increasing complexity of communications networks and growing network traffic, and legal and compliance requirements. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, revenue from communications intelligence solutions represented approximately 26%, 28% and 23% of Verint’s total revenue, respectively.


* '''Verint’s Strategy'''

There are several elements to Verint’s strategy, including:

* Continue to drive the development of Actionable Intelligence solutions for unstructured data. 

Verint was a pioneer in the development of solutions that help businesses and governmental organizations derive intelligence from unstructured data. 

Verint intends to continue its leadership in this area and to further drive the adoption of '''Actionable Intelligence''' solutions by delivering solutions to the enterprise workforce optimization and security intelligence markets that integrate Actionable Intelligence from unstructured data with data from other sources, including unstructured data, and those are designed to provide a high return on investment.

* Maintain market leadership through innovation and customer centricity . 

Verint believes that to compete successfully it must continue to introduce solutions that better enable customers to derive Actionable Intelligence from their unstructured data. In order to do this, '''Verint intends to continue to make significant investments in research and development, protect its intellectual property through patents and other means''', and maintain a regular dialogue with its customers in order to understand their business objectives and requirements.

* Continue to expand Verint’s market presence through partnerships and alliances, including OEM relationships . Verint has expanded its partnerships and alliances with integrators, resellers, distributors, OEMs and others. Verint believes that these relationships broaden its market coverage and intends to continue expanding its existing relationships and creating new ones.

* Augment Verint’s organic growth with acquisitions. 

Verint examines acquisition opportunities regularly as a means to add technology, increase its geographic presence, enhance its market leadership, or expand into adjacent markets. Historically, Verint has engaged in acquisitions for all of these purposes and expects to continue doing so in the future when strategic opportunities arise.

* ''Key Trends and Developments in Verint’s Business''

Verint believes that there are many factors that affect its ability to sustain and increase both revenue and profitability, including:

Information technology spending. During the continuing weakness in the global economy, information technology spending has decreased, and the market for Verint’s products and services has been adversely affected. Verint’s growth and results depend in part on the pace of economic recovery and spending on information technology.  	

Market acceptance of Actionable Intelligence for unstructured data, '''particularly analytics'''. Verint is in an early stage market where the value of certain aspects of its products and solutions is still in the process of market acceptance. Verint believes that its future growth depends in part on the continued and increasing acceptance of the value of its '''data analytics''' across its product offerings. .."
