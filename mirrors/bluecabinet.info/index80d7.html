"AxxonSoft has supported us every step of the way to help develop and deliver the best solution for our clients."

ViewOptix used these key features of Axxon's Intellect platform to meet the needs of medical marijuana facilities:

* Axxon’s systems are all fully scalable from the smallest to the largest facility. It is a future-proof and economical platform that eliminates the need to replace and purchase new systems to keep up with corporate growth and expansion.

* Axxon integrates with point-of-sale functions at dispensaries for analyzing data from cash registers and scales, and monitoring activity at the safe. It also allows for seed-to-sale tracking through GPS locating, barcode and radio frequency identification (RFID).
