=== Background ===
[http://www.creativitysoftware.net/ CREATIVITY SOFTWARE] is a privately-held UK based company specializing in lawful interception, Location Positioning Infrastructure For GSM &amp; CDMA networks -- For 2G, 3G and 4G -- and for Commercial Applications. Known for providing their interception product to Iran. Established in 2001, Creativity Software partners with mobile network operators (wireless carriers), mobile device manufacturers, service providers and large enterprises globally. Their offices are in the UK and China, with distributors in Latin America, the Middle East and India.  

Partners in the Middle East include [http://www.actelme.com/ Actel] that provides services to not only Iran, but to Syria. Surveillance technology at the moment is not controlled under the current [http://www.iranfocus.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=24076:uk-mulls-ban-on-sale-of-tracking-software-to-iran-and-syria&amp;catid=4:iran-general&amp;Itemid=26 UK export] licensing system. 

"In 2011, London-based Creativity Software provided Iran with a location-tracking system that can track a target’s movement every 15 seconds and plot the locations on a map. Creativity employees were concerned about selling such technology to Iran, knowing how easily it could be abused for illicit purposes."

The applications and products are used by the police and government agencies in surveillance and interception of mobile phones and computers using 2G, 3G or 4G. These "location aware" applications are supplied for Intel-based Mobile Internet Devices (MID).
