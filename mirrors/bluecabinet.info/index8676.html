"DtecNet brings technology and expertise in pinpointing and monitoring illegal download activity on P2P networks, blogs, video streaming sites and Usenet services, the company said.

DtecNet founder and CEO Thomas Sehested will join MarkMonitor as a senior vice president.

With the acquisition, MarkMonitor is also expanding on a geographical level: DtecNet’s European operations include a development team in Denmark and an operations center in Vilnius, Lithuania.

Irfan Salim, CEO of MarkMonitor, says piracy of digital content on the Internet, including movies, music, games, software and e-books, is a severe and growing problem."
