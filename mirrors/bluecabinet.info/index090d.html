'''HISTORY of SECURITAS DIRECT'''


'''2006''': Securitas AB (SECUB), the world’s largest security company, spun off its alarm and security business, Securitas Direct, in 2006. Securitas Direct is a security company based in Malmö, Sweden and active in 9 European countries. It was listed at Nasdaq OMX Stockholm in 2006, when it was distributed to the shareholders of Securitas AB. 

'''2008''': The EQT V fund bought the unit for 10.1 billion kronor in 2008 after raising the bid to overcome shareholders’ opposition.[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-23/bain-capital-hellman-friedman-buy-securitas.html Bloomberg 2011].

'''2008''': Securitas Direct creates '''[http://www.eqt.se/en/Media/Container/ESML-Intressenter-AB-has-received-the-necessary-clearances-from-relevant-competition-authorities-regarding-the-offer-to-the-shareholders-in-Securitas-Direct/ ESML Intressenter AB]'''  "ESML Intressenter AB has been established by '''EQT V, SäkI AB, Melker Schörling AB and Investment AB Latour''' to accomplish the offer for Securitas Direct." They delist Securitas Direct from NASDAQ OMX and receive clearance to sell.

'''2011''':  ESML sells Securitas Direct to '''Bain Capital and Hellman &amp; Friedman''' ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitas_Direct Wikipedia])

* EQT, the Swedish private equity firm, sold the alarm system company [http://www.eqt.se/en/Portfolio/Companies/Securitas-Direct/ Securitas Direct to Bain Capital] and Hellman &amp; Friedman for up to 21.9 billion Swedish kronor, or $3.4 billion, in June 2011.

''' Vigilance Dashboard''':

"Vigilance sorts through massive amounts of private and public data, filtering to convey "essential" information and visualizing it for security teams and customers. This capability delivers time-sensitive information to handling risk in a comprehensive manner. While  Vigilance display modules present a range of information in the form of images, video, voice, graphics and documents, as well as specially format "ted alerts". Types of information brought into the environment range from 9-1-1 data to breaking news stories, and from flash flood advisories to traffic flows and weather radar. Internal incidents and assets can be imported and displayed, as well, allowing a layered view. Clients can subscribe to world news, and specific communities of information designed for their individual needs. Advanced filters allow the user to tailor what information is displayed, what incidents generate email or SMS text alerts to specified personnel, and define areas and times of coverage.  Each “community” information area is constructed to fuse types and sources of information relating to a specific geographic area or subject matter. Subscribers can be members of multiple communities, as many as "necessary" to achieve total surveillance of events and conditions potentially impacting their operations."
