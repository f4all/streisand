<p>"Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC) is a major intelligence, military, aerospace, engineering and systems contractor. It is involved in defense/military (DoD), intelligence community, and homeland security contracting, as well as selected commercial markets.
</p><p>As a March 2007 Vanity Fair article published by the investigative journalist duo Bartlett and Steele put it SAIC "sells human beings who have a particular expertise—expertise about weapons, about homeland security, about <b>surveillance, about computer systems</b>, about <b>information dominance and information warfare.</b> ... What everyone agrees on is this: No Washington contractor pursues government money with more ingenuity and perseverance than SAIC. ... <b>No contractor seems to exploit conflicts of interest in Washington with more zeal</b>. And no contractor cloaks its operations in greater <b>secrecy</b>. SAIC almost never touts its activities in public, preferring to stay well below the radar."" <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.crocodyl.org/wiki/science_applications_international_corp">crocodyl.org</a>
