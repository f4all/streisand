</li>
</ul>
<p>"This combinatorial skill – to unlock meaningful value from series of historical data and activity in motion – is the power of an event-enabled enterprise. Rather than analyzing massive amounts of information in a one-time effort, it processes data in real time as things change – continuously deciphering the meaning of what’s happening in the moment based on what’s known from the past...
</p><p>How It Works: Understand. Anticipate. Act.
</p><p>Registering activity across the enterprise, it can sense when opportunities and risks are coming and systematically ensure the right person (or system) has the right information before outcomes crystallize – what TIBCO calls the two-second advantage®.
</p><p>Whether it's two minutes or two hours, it's an opportunity to take action before outcomes crystallize, redirect the course of activity, and optimize results.
</p><p>The Building Blocks
</p>
<ul>
<li> Automation: Ensure real-time information is available and can be accessed, consumed, and acted on by any application, person, or process across geographical boundaries, channels, and touch points
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Event Processing: Understand the cause of opportunities and risks so you can track and act on when they happen next
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Analytics: Find actionable insights at the speed of thought by enabling users to spot patterns, examine outliers, and share trends in data
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Cloud: Meet fluctuating demands with an efficiency that optimizes your IT cost structure.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Social: Allow employees, customers, and partners to collaborate with each other and interact with information located in any system

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Vivek_Ranadiv.C3.A9.2C_Chairman.2C_CEO.2C_Founder">Vivek Ranadivé, Chairman, CEO, Founder</span></h5>
<p>"Mr. Ranadivé founded TIBCO in 1997 with the vision of bringing real-time technology into the mainstream. His acclaimed New York Times business bestseller <b>The Power of Now: How Winning Companies Sense and Respond to Change Using Real-time Technology (1999)</b> has been widely used in academia and been the subject of numerous interviews. His subsequent book, <b>The Power to Predict (2006)</b>, shows the impact of predictive business on mainstream companies from Procter &amp; Gamble to Harrah's and reveals how companies can break new ground in their quest to anticipate customers' needs, create new opportunities, and predict and sidestep unwelcome surprises.
</p><p>Mr. Ranadivé has appeared as a featured expert on real-time computing on CNBC and in publications such as The Economist, Fast Company, and Red Herring. Mr. Ranadivé has consistently been recognized as a visionary for the future of business integration, securing him a place in InfoWorld's 2002 Top Ten Technology Innovators. He was recognized by Ernst &amp; Young as a 2002 Software Entrepreneur of the Year. In 2008, he was named the South Asian CEO of the Year by SAMBAA. He was also featured in “Annals of Innovation: How David Beats Goliath,” a New Yorker article by Malcolm Gladwell, author of The Tipping Point and Outliers, as an example of innovators who win by “breaking the rules.”
</p><p>Prior to founding TIBCO, Mr. Ranadivé was president and <b>founder of a UNIX consulting company</b>. Previously, he held management and engineering positions with <b>Ford Motor Company, M/A-Com Linkabit, and Fortune Systems</b>. Mr. Ranadivé is a frequent presenter on such topics as the future of integration, enabling real-time business, and unleashing the power of information across enterprises to become more competitive. 
</p><p>Mr. Ranadivé earned an MBA from Harvard Business School, where he was a Baker Scholar. He received both a Master's and Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
