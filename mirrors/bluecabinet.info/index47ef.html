=== Background ===

Arbor Network is a subsid of Tektronix Communications, a "full service, end-to-end Telecoms Intelligence Provider." "Tektronix Communications is part of the [http://www.danaher.com/ Danaher Group]"

2014: "Arbor was named one of the top ten most brilliant DARPA inventions of all time – alongside the Internet itself, Google Maps and GPS." [http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/about-us]

2010: [http://www.tekcomms.com/about-us Tektronix Communications] to buy Arbor Networks [http://www.businessweek.com/idg/2010-08-10/tektronix-communications-to-buy-arbor-networks.html]

2008: "Ellacoya was acquired by Arbor Networks" [http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/management-team/donald-w-pratt-jr]

'''Corporate Operations'''

Headquartered in the '''United States''', Arbor Networks operates out of Burlington, MA, with R&amp;D facilities in Ann Arbor, MI, and Atlanta, GA. Our '''Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)''' operations are based in '''London,UK,''' while our Asia operations are based in '''Singapore'''.

"Arbor was founded out of groundbreaking research conducted at the '''University of Michigan'''. This research was eventually '''funded by the U.S. Defense Agency Research Projects Administration (DARPA)'''... Since then, Arbor has focused exclusively on researching, detecting and mitigating network-based threats. The company is best known for its pervasive footprint in service provider networks. '''Arbor technology is deployed in 70% of service provider networks globally, including 90% of tier one operators. Arbor technology is also broadly deployed among the largest hosting and cloud providers.'''

Arbor has been working with the world’s leading enterprise network operators since 2003, counting '''more than 150 leading financial services, retail, social media and healthcare brands, as well as universities and government organizations, as customers.'''

Arbor created ATLAS, '''a collaborative project with more than 230+ service providers who have agreed to share anonymous Internet traffic data with Arbor’s Security Engineering &amp; Response Team -- ASERT'''. This data, totaling 35Tbps, is enhanced by Arbor’s '''global honeypot network of 45+ sensors in the dark, unused address space of provider customer networks. That information is aggregated, analyzed by our ASERT team and fed back to our customers in the form of attack signatures, via our product deployments'''.  From this unique vantage point, Arbor is ideally positioned to '''deliver intelligence about DDoS, malware, botnets, exploits and phishing attacks''' that threaten Internet infrastructure and services today. Ultimately, ATLAS gives Arbor customers a considerable competitive advantage by giving them both a micro view of their own network '''combined with a macro view of global Internet traffic'''...

With the unique visibility provided by ATLAS, Arbor security researchers are sought out for their insight and analysis of critical security and infrastructure issues such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, Domain Name System (DNS) security and the adoption of IPv6, as well as global Internet events. Arbor has been invited to testify before the '''House of Lords''' on behalf of the '''European Union''' on the subject of “Protecting Europe Against Large-Scale Cyber-Attacks” and has '''briefed NATO''' and many other international organizations and governments around the world on network infrastructure and security vulnerabilities...

Arbor’s long-standing relationships and reputation as a trusted advisor and solution provider make the '''annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report''' possible. This report offers a rare view into the challenges of network operators on the front lines of a global battle against botnets and DDoS attacks..." [http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/about-us]
