</p><p>Marcus Wallenberg's role came naturally. He had been responsible for the Kreuger loans at SEB. He established close contacts with Sosthenes Behn, president of ITT, and thus created a strong position for himself as a mediator between the two largest owners.<i>"</i>

</p><p>"AXE based equipment are being used as BSC/TRC, MSC, HLR, SCP, FNR, TSC and wireline nodes.
</p><p>The brain of the AXE system is a dual processor system called APZ. It runs in parallel sync mode making it fault redundant. The family of APZs started with APZ 210 03 in 1976; the latest one is APZ 212 60. The parallel sync mode was partly abandoned in the APZ 212 40 and subsequent models and has been replaced with a warm standby scheme.
</p><p>The latest APZ type is 214 03 which is use as MSC, TSC and HLR Blade in AXE. The latest implementation of AXE is on a blade cluster system capable of handling up to 8 million subscribers.
</p><p>The core of the switching part was the Group Switch, initially a time-space-time multiplexer capable of switching up to 64K positions or connections. This Group Switch later evolved to a Distributed Group Switch using Time-Space switching technique with a maximum capacity of 512K.
