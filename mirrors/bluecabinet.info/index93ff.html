=== Background ===

'''Glimmerglass Networks Inc.''' provides for cyber-security and [http://www.glimmerglass.com/solutions/cyber-security-and-lawful-interception/ lawful interception] -- Optical Distribution for the Intellegence Community.

Glimmerglass is a privately held company financed by leading institutional investors.

" Glimmerglass Networks, Inc. develops and integrates optical cyber solutions. It offers intelligent optical systems; and intelligent peripheral systems, which include system control modules, lossless splitters, high-density splitters, and dual optical amplifiers... 
The company serves cyber security, intelligence and defense, lawful interception, cyber lab automation, and telecom network monitoring customers; and telecom central offices/POPs and '''submarine cable landing stations worldwide'''. 

It offers its products directly; and through distributors and integrators in Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific " [http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=691177 Businessweek]

'''NOTE''': 6.3.2013: [http://www.verticalnews.com/article.php?articleID=9519758 Glimmerglass Networks, Inc. has been issued patent application serial number 626812] "a patent application by the inventors Chau, Kelvin (Pleasanton, CA), filed on September 25, 2012, was made available online on May 9, 2013." [http://www.verticalnews.com/article.php?articleID=9377031]

" '''Glimmerglass Intelligent Optical System''' integrates powerful software with cutting-edge hardware to provide unmatched flexibility, performance, and cost savings for enabling Cyber Security and executing Lawful Interception on optical networks. Organizations use Glimmerglass to monitor and selectively intercept communications, distribute optical signals to one or many locations, and centrally manage the process on demand from remote locations. Furthermore, '''Glimmerglass leverages purely optical, photonic signal management to create a ‘transparent’ cross-connect'''. A transparent cross-connect accepts and reconfigures an optical signal without regard for its data rate or protocol. This means that a Glimmerglass IOS that manages 1G to 10G data rate signals today can manage 40G or 100G signals once the network evolves, without the need for hardware or even software upgrades." [http://www.glimmerglass.com/solutions/cyber-security-and-lawful-interception/ Glimmerglass] 

"The Glimmerglass Intelligent Optical System, a key component of the Glimmerglass CyberSweep™ solution, addresses these issues, allowing operators to rapidly and remotely access, monitor, and distribute optical signals for network monitoring and Lawful Intercept applications... CSPs, LEAs, and intelligence agencies use the Intelligent Optical System to rapidly access target optical signal streams and distribute them to signal processing and monitoring equipment, all without disrupting network traffic..."
