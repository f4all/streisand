<p>"Cubic Corporation (Cubic), incorporated in 1949, is involved in <b>the design, development, manufacture, integration, installation, operation, maintenance, and support of high technology products and systems</b>. 
</p><p>The Company is also a provider of training, operations, <b>intelligence</b>, maintenance, technical, and other support services to the <b>United States Government and allied nations</b>.
</p><p>The Company is focused on the defense and transportation markets and has also added <b>cyber security and asset tracking businesses</b>. 
</p><p>The Company operates in three reportable segments: transportation systems, defense systems and mission support services."

<b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://bit.ly/QPSRzH">As of August 22, 2012 Cubic Corporation was notified by the staff of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that they were not in compliance with required reporting regulations</a></b> See also: The Associated Press, August 1, 2012 <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sddt.com/news/article.cfm?SourceCode=20120801tqa">Cubic Corp. to restate earnings for past 3 years</a>

</p><p><b>Why is Cubic Corporation having such difficulty keeping track of their finances and filing reports on time? </b>
</p><p><b>Who in Cubic has this responsibility?</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Mark A. Harrison, CPA, is Chief Accounting Officer</b>, Vice President, Corporate Controller of Cubic Corp. He served as Vice President and Corporate Controller since 2004 and Vice President—Financial Planning and Accounting from 2000 to 2004.

</ul>
<ul>
<li> <b>John D. Thomas, CPA, MBA, is the Vice President - Finance, Vice President</b> - Corporate Development of Cubic Corp. He served as Vice President Finance since 1994 and also Vice President Corporate Development since 2008. He has held a variety of financial management positions with the Corporation since 1980.

</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably more than just Thomas and Harrison. Cubic is spending millions of dollars on accounting, yet not in compliance with the reporting regulations of the New York Stock Exchange. Appears at this point that the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission should investigate.

"Under the contract, <b>Cubic will assist General Dynamics</b> in supporting both JEXP Concept Development and experimentation events. Tasks for the GD/Cubic team may include helping to improve military capabilities by exploring, testing, evaluating and establishing new changes based on proposals for changing military doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel and facilities.
</p><p>"Warfighting experiments conducted by JEXP and the Joint Futures Lab are an important part of transformation, a process that helps our country identify new skills and technologies needed in this new era of asymmetric warfare," said Rich Bristow, vice president and general manager of Cubic's Operations Support Division based in Hampton, Va.
</p><p>Cubic has had a presence in the Tidewater area of Virginia since 1994, when it <b>helped establish the Joint Warfighting Center</b> (JWFC) at Fort Monroe, Va., and currently has more than 160 employees supporting JWFC. In addition to working on the <b>Joint National Training Capability initiative</b>, the employees assist combatant commands by helping to coordinate support and seminars, wargames and live, virtual and constructive training exercises -- as well as <b>providing mission rehearsal support for real-world events</b>.
</p><p>"Cubic is proud to have an additional opportunity to support JFCOM in this effort to maintain and extend strategic superiority," Bristow said.
</p><p>Cubic's <b>Operations Support Division is part of the Mission Support Business Unit of Cubic Defense Applications</b> (CDA). CDA provides realistic combat training systems for military forces, as well as mission support services for training and exercises, modeling and simulation, force modernization, educational services, curriculum design and development, web-based learning solutions, operations and maintenance and manufacturing services.<b> The group also supplies products and systems for C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) applications</b>, search and rescue avionics and radio communications for military and civil markets.
