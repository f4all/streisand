'''Bandwidth Management'''

We introduce the term '''Dynamic Network Bandwidth Management''' to describe the collection of tools necessary to manage the stress that UC applications put on the underlying communications infrastructure. The main objectives of these tools are to:

*1. Relegate decisions about audio/video bandwidth utilization from end-users to administrators. Administrators control bandwidth allocated to audio/video calls through centrally-provisioned call rate policies. Not only does this place responsibility for bandwidth allocations where it belongs—with the administrator—but it alsoresults in an improved end-user experience by hiding complexities of bandwidth and call rates from the user.

*2. Reconcile bandwidth allocated to audio/video calls with the physical constraints of the underlying network. This is done to:

**1. Constrain the amount of bandwidth used by UC to limit the impact of Unified Communications on other network applications. For example, users making video calls shouldn't cause SAP to come to a grinding halt or stop Citrix applications from working.

**2. Protect bandwidth allocated to UC from other traffic sharing the network to optimize the Quality of Experience (QoE) to the end user. In essence, the system needs to ensure that the amount of bandwidth required for the conversation is available for the duration of that conversation to ensure a high quality-of-experience to the end user.

**3. Police access to available UC bandwidth in light of requests from various UC users and applications. This is done by integrating with the signaling infrastructure to allow application software to make intelligent decisions about how to deal with bandwidth shortages and how to communicate lack of bandwidth to the end-user.

'''Network bandwidth management software''' accomplishes these goals through an integrated collection of dynamic software mechanisms and policies that control and manage bandwidth used by Unified Communications. Bandwidth management policies allocate a certain amount of bandwidth to each UC session based on which users are involved in the session, the type of session or event, the capabilities of the endpoints used, the network constraints imposed by the administrator, and any other network activity going on at the same time. UC management infrastructure enforces these constraints, while UC applications attempt to optimize the overall end-user experience within the boundaries of these constraints.
