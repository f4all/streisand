<p>Pen-Link is a Privately held company.
In September 2007, "Murman sold 30 percent of his stock in the firm to employees, setting up an employee stock ownership program that will allow workers to share in the ownership of the company." <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-169130942.html">Omaha World Tribune</a>
</p><p><b>Since 1998, Pen-Link, Ltd. has sponsored the “CALEA Implementation Agent” (CIA) Training.</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.penlink.com/PenLinkCIA/tabid/64/Default.aspx">Pen-Link</a>
</p><p>"In business for over 20 years, Pen-Link, Ltd. provides <b>Law Enforcement and Intelligence agencies</b> with state-of-the-art <b>software and systems for the collection, storage, and analysis of telephonic- and IP-based communications</b>. Pen-Link’s software and systems -- Pen-Link 8, LINCOLN, and Xnet -- are widely recognized as industry standards, with thousands of licensed Law Enforcement and Intelligence users in federal, state, and local agencies worldwide. Pen-Link systems are widely favored because they not only excel at intelligence gathering and live collection, but they also bring to bear a powerful <b>suite of reporting and analytical tools</b>; the type of functionality that is essential in <b>drilling down through today’s extensive data sets to reveal relationships that might otherwise go undetected</b>." -Pen-Link-

</p><p><br />
One US Court has ruled that a Pen-Link wiretap report was admissible, according to the website news page as it appears below. It is currently unknown to Telecomix Blue cabinet researchers if this court case decision was before the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court. Since only one judges name appears, "Honorable Judge Alfred A. Delucchi," we assume it is a lower court decision and not case law.
</p><p>"Pen-Link Testimony Satisfies Court - Tuesday, March 02, 2004
Press Release from Pen-Link, Ltd., Lincoln, NE.  March 2, 2004, 4:30 PM, Central Time
</p><p>Summary:  Mr. Mike Murman and Dr. Kevin Clements, from Pen-Link, Ltd., testified on March 1, 2004, in the case of the People vs. Scott Peterson. Pen-Link, Ltd. is the manufacturer of the LINCOLN System used to tap Peterson's phones. The morning after hearing testimony from Murman and Clements, the Honorable Judge Alfred A. Delucchi issued a ruling to allow the wiretap information into evidence.  Murman and Clements are extremely pleased about this ruling."

<li> The following is an excerpt from a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/06/71022?currentPage=all">Wired</a> story in 2006 "Crashing the Wiretapper Ball." It is a perfect example of the ongoing lack of accountability that surveillance companies have, regarding the abuse of their products, especially in the hands of tyrants and dictatorships.

"In the bar that night, things got interesting. A group of men associated with the Pen-Link and Lincoln electronic surveillance systems came in. I exchanged small talk with them for a bit, then moved to their table. Although I had identified myself as a journalist, an enthusiastic reseller of the equipment decided to hold forth. We drank a great deal, so I won't name him.
</p><p>"I'm not much concerned about wiretaps in America and Europe," I'd been saying to one of the Pen-Link engineers, "but I wonder if it bothers you to consider what this technology can do in the hands of repressive governments with no judicial oversight, no independent legislature."
</p><p>Our man interrupted. "You need to educate yourself," he said with a sneer. "I mean, that's a classic journalist's question, but why are you hassling these guys? They're engineers. They make a product. They don't sell it. What the hell is it to them what anyone does with it?"
</p><p>"Well, it's quite an issue," I said. "This is the equipment of totalitarianism, and the only things that can keep a population safe are decent law and proper oversight. I want to know what they think when they learn that China, or Syria, or Zimbabwe is getting their hands on it."
</p><p>"You really need to educate yourself," he insisted. "Do you think this stuff doesn't happen in the West? Let me tell you something. <b>I sell this equipment all over the world, especially in the Middle East. I deal with buyers from Qatar</b>, and I get more concern about proper legal procedure from them than I get in the USA."
</p><p>"Well, perhaps the Qataris are conscientious," I said, "and I'm prepared to take your word on that, but there are seriously oppressive governments out there itching to get hold of this stuff."
</p><p>He sneered again. <b> "Do you think for a minute that Bush would let legal issues stop him from doing surveillance?</b> He's got to prevent a terrorist attack that everyone knows is coming. He'll do absolutely anything he thinks is going to work. And so would you. So why are you bothering these guys?"
</p><p>"It's a valid question," I insisted. "This is powerful stuff. In the wrong hands, it could ruin political opponents; it could make the state's power impossible to challenge. The state would know basically everything. People would be getting rounded up for thought crimes."
</p><p>"You're not listening," he said. <b> "The NSA is using this stuff. The DEA, the Secret Service, the CIA.</b> Are you kidding me? They don't answer to you. They do whatever the hell they want with it. Are you really that naïve? Now leave these guys alone; they make a product, that's all. It's nothing to them what happens afterward. You really need to educate yourself.""

With the latest release, we have built on our long-standing tradition of providing interfaces for all types of telecommunication cases.

</p><p>"Some of the biggest <b>enhancements to Pen-Link v8.2  involve new and enhanced monitor roles for monitoring live calls</b>. For example, the enhanced Primary Monitor role allows a user to be a Primary Monitor on multiple Targets simultaneously, and the new Secondary Monitor role allows greater flexibility in distributing human resources. These new and enhanced monitor roles improve the sequence of events that occur when a new call begins."

<li> <b>LINCOLN Collection System</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"LINCOLN provides a complete system solution for any CALEA-based or facilities-based (local loop) approach to electronic surveillance.  Our <b>system encompasses hardware, software, and services to meet all of the intercept needs</b> of an LEA.
</p><p>The core LINCOLN <b>System is built on server hardware and client/server software that is typically run on a Local Area Network (LAN) in the wireroom</b>.  
</p><p>Our LINCOLN <b>product is the LAN server, consisting of a LINCOLN Server Platform (hardware) running LINCOLN 2 Administrative Software</b>.  
</p><p>The <b>client workstations on the LAN run a network installation of Pen-Link software</b>.
</p><p>The LINCOLN <b>Server is equipped with the hardware necessary to terminate the physical connections of the e interface for any carrier that offers CALEA-compliant delivery</b>.  With these connections in place, the LINCOLN <b>System essentially becomes a passive node on the telecommunication carriers’ networks, so that it may receive real-time intercept information delivered by the carriers</b>, for any of the agency’s legally authorized intercepts.  
</p><p>The <b>collection process itself is controlled by the Pen-Link 8 client software</b>, which also offers a suite of unparalleled analytical capabilities."
</p><p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>LINCOLN Server</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"The LINCOLN Server is where all incoming CALEA CDC and CCC connections terminate.   LINCOLN routes live call data and call content to the appropriate Pen-Link workstations.  In a normal network setting, LINCOLN records all intercepted call content, making multiple redundant copies.  The LINCOLN Server also stores all data in Pen-Link’s database, providing central storage for the LAN."
</p><p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>LINCOLN Access Points (LAP)</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"The advancement of CALEA, especially in wireless telephone applications, has caused many of the traditional "tip and ring" technical agents to reduce the number of pen register cases at a state and local law enforcement level because of costs.  Furthermore, in order for an analog tech agent to be effective in managing pen, trap &amp; trace, and wiretap investigations, their skills must be centered in computer and networking technology.  Unfortunately, for many state and local law enforcement agencies, the costs and perhaps lack of technical skills to conduct CALEA based intercepts has forced them to abandon the use of pen register orders to gain valuable and timely intelligence on the target of an investigation.  If your agency has fallen into this category, we are here to let you know that now is the time to get back into the "pen" business.  We've developed a cost effective, cooperative law enforcement effort called LINCOLN Access Points (LAP) that will get you back into the "pen" business."

</p><p>Imagine this… suppose you’re an investigator on a fugitive case. You know if you can get the number of a wireless phone the fugitive is using, then you would be a huge step closer to tracking him down. The problem is you don’t have the phone number. There are various approaches and investigative techniques to “developing” the needed target phone number. Some such approaches involve the phones of known associates of the fugitive: family, friends, old girlfriend, ex-wife, etc. <b>Suppose you should happen to come into temporary possession of the cell phones of some of these associates, even if only for a brief moment?
