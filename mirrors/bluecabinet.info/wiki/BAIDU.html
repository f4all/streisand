<p>"Baidu was founded in 2000 by Internet pioneer <b>Robin Li, creator of visionary search technology Hyperlink Analysis</b>, with the mission of providing the best way for people to find what they’re looking for online. Over the past decade we have strived to fulfill this mission by listening carefully to our users’ needs and wants. To provide intelligent, relevant search results for the tens of billions of queries that are entered into our search platform every day, we focus on powering the best technology optimized for up-to-date local tastes and preferences. Our deep understanding of Chinese language and culture is central to our success and this kind of knowledge allows us to tailor our search technology for our users’ needs. Just to cite one example, we believe there are at least 38 ways of saying "I" in the Chinese language. It is important that we recognize these nuances to effectively address our users’ requests.
</p><p>We provide our users with many channels to find and share information. In addition to our core web search product, we power many popular community-based products, such as Baidu PostBar, the world’s first and largest Chinese-language query-based searchable online community platform, Baidu Knows, the world’s largest Chinese-language interactive knowledge-sharing platform, and Baidu Encyclopedia, the world’s largest user-generated Chinese-language encyclopedia, to name but a few. Beyond these marquee products we also offer dozens of helpful vertical search-based products, such as Maps, Image Search, Video Search, News Search, and many more. We power these through our cutting-edge technology, continually innovating to enhance these services. Our new Box Computing Open Platform brings users deep-linked content and even applications they can use directly through their search box. We believe that Box Computing will dramatically improve people’s search experience and become ubiquitous across all Internet devices including computers and mobile platforms...

He has substantially advanced the theoretical framework of China’s Internet sciences, and has become a driving force behind the overall technology development of the entire Chinese IT industry. While satisfying Chinese-language search needs at home, Robin has also proactively sought to internationalize Baidu. Currently, Baidu is vigorously preparing itself for entrance into the broader international market.
</p><p>As a pioneer and leader of China’s Internet industry, he has received honors including “CCTV Key Figure in China’s Economy,” “The Top 30 Figures in China’s 30 Years of Reform,” “China’s Most Imaginative Entrepreneur,” and many others. On several occasions, U.S.-based magazines such as BusinessWeek and Fortune Magazine have designated Robin’s as “Best Business Leader in the World” and “China’s Most Influential Business Leader.” Robin was also named by Time Magazine as one of the “World’s Most Influential People” in 2010.
