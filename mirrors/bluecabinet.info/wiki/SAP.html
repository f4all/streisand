<p>SPECIAL NOTE:
</p><p>SAP has been included in Blue cabinet, due making customized products, partnering with the company <b>NetApp</b> [known to be used by the Syrian govt.], <b>Cisco</b> and other companies known for surveillance products i.e. Deep Packet Inspection, Interception, Filtering, Tracking. These companies work with SAP in R&amp;D - <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sap.com/partners/COIL/index.epx">SAP Partners GLOBAL SAP CO-INNOVATION LAB (COIL) NETWORK</a></b> Switzerland. * <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEnT4o8trIw&amp;feature=relmfu">INTEL VP, Data Center Group</a> explains why collaborating with SAP is a "Game Changer"
</p><p>In addition, Blue cabinet has concerns over BIG DATA, Data`Rentention and Data Centers that are acquiring and collecting personal data. Whether for surveillance, identifying dissidents, activists or for other more acceptable reasons i.e. Climate/Weather -- it appears that some of the SAP products, when integrated with non-SAP products used for Deep Packet Inspection, Data Mining, Data Rentention and Data Analysis, contribute towards greater surveillance abilities in time and storage. 
</p><p><b>Not all Blue cabinet/BSRE contributors are convinced that SAP belongs in the wiki.</b> At this time it is unknown what "custom" products SAP and integration has been used for surveillance or censorship.
