<p>"Palo Alto Networks, Inc. offers a network security platform that allows enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure their networks and enable various applications running on their networks. 
</p><p>The core of the company’s platform is its <b>Next-Generation Firewall</b> that delivers application, user, and content visibility and control integrated within the firewall through its proprietary operating system, hardware, and software architecture. 
</p><p>It primarily sells its products and services to end-customers through its channel partners and infrequently directly to end-customers. 
</p><p>The company’s partners are supported by its sales and marketing organization in the Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; and the Asia Pacific and Japan. 
</p><p>The company’s products and services could address a range of its end-customers’ network security requirements, from the data center to the network perimeter, as well as the distributed enterprise, which includes branch offices and various mobile devices. 
</p><p><b>Its platform is based on a traffic classification engine that identifies network traffic by application, user, and content.</b> The company’s platform is delivered in the form of a hardware or virtual appliance and includes a suite of subscription services, as well as support and maintenance. 
</p><p>The company’s appliances incorporate its PAN-OS operating system and are based on its proprietary identification technologies, application visibility and control (App-ID), user identification (User-ID), and content-ID, which allow security policies to be defined within the context of applications, users, and content. 
</p><p>It serves the enterprise network security market, which consists of firewall, unified threat management, Web gateway, intrusion detection and prevention, and virtual private network (VPN) technologies. The company sells its platform through a channel fulfilled sales model. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> Products and Services Appliances 
</li>
</ul>
<p>All firewall appliances come with the same set of features ensuring consistent operation across the entire product line. These features include App-ID, User-ID, site-to-site VPN, remote access SSL VPN, and quality-of-service (QoS). The company classifies its appliances based on throughput. In addition to firewall appliances, it offers Panorama and WildFire appliances. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> Panorama: 
</li>
</ul>
<p>Panorama is the company’s centralized security management solution for global control of all of its appliances deployed on an end-customer’s network as a virtual appliance or a physical appliance. Panorama is used for centralized policy management, device management, software licensing and updates, centralized logging and reporting, and log storage. Panorama controls the security, network address translation, QoS, policy based forwarding, <b>decryption</b>, application override, captive portal, and DDoS/DoS protection aspects of the appliances and virtual systems under management. Panorama centrally manages device software and associated updates, including SSL-VPN clients, GlobalProtect clients, content updates, and software licenses. Panorama offers the ability to view logs and run reports from all managed appliances without the need to forward the logs and to report on aggregate user activity for various users, <b>including mobile users</b>. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> Virtual System Upgrades: 
</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtual System Upgrades are available as extensions to the virtual system capacity that ships with the appliance. Virtual systems provide a virtualization solution to the company’s enterprise and service provider end-customers that implement data centers, private cloud, and public cloud security infrastructures and need to support a multi-tenant firewall environment. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> Subscription Services: 
</li>
</ul>
<p>The company offers various subscription services as part of its platform. These services comprise: 
</p><p>Threat Prevention Subscription: 
</p><p>This service provides the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities of the company’s platform. Its threat prevention engine blocks vulnerability exploits, viruses, spyware, buffer overflows, denial-of-service attacks, and port scans from compromising and damaging enterprise information resources. It includes mechanisms, such as protocol decoder-based analysis, protocol anomaly-based protection, stateful pattern matching, statistical anomaly detection, heuristic-based analysis, custom vulnerability, and spyware phone home signatures. 
</p><p>URL Filtering Subscription: 
</p><p>This service provides the URL filtering capabilities of the company’s platform. The URL filtering database consists of various URLs across various categories and <b>is designed to monitor and control employee Web surfing activities</b>. The on-appliance URL database could be augmented to suit the traffic patterns of the local user community with a custom URL database. 
</p><p>GlobalProtect Subscription: 
</p><p>This service provides protection for mobile users of both traditional laptop devices and mobile devices. It expands the boundaries of the physical network, establishing a logical perimeter that includes remote laptop and mobile device users irrespective of their location. When a remote user logs into the device, GlobalProtect automatically determines the gateway available to the roaming device and establishes a secure connection. <b>Windows and Apple laptops, as well as such mobile devices as Apple iPhones and iPads, would stay connected to the corporate network whenever they are on a network of any kind. As a result they are protected as if they never left the corporate campus.</b> 
</p><p>WildFire Subscription: 
</p><p>This service provides protection against targeted modern malware and advanced persistent threats. Its cloud-based analysis service provides a near real-time analysis engine for detecting previously unseen modern malware. The core component of this service is a sandbox environment that could operate on an end-customers' private cloud or the company’s public cloud where files could be run and monitored for approximately 100 behavioral characteristics that identify the file as malware. 
</p><p>Support and Maintenance: 
</p><p>The company offers technical support on its products and subscriptions to its end-customers and channel partners. It offers standard support, premium support, and 4-hour premium support. <b>The company’s channel partners that operate a Palo Alto Networks Authorized Support Center deliver level-one and level-two support.</b> 
</p><p>The company <b>provides level-3 support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through regional support centers that are located worldwide.</b> 
</p><p>It also offers an annual subscription-based technical account management service that <b>provides support for end-customers with complex support requirements.</b> The company offers its end-customers ongoing maintenance services for both hardware and software to receive ongoing security updates, PAN-OS upgrades, bug fixes, and repair. Additionally, it provides expedited replacement for any defective hardware. 
</p><p><b>The company uses a third-party logistics provider to manage its worldwide deployment of spare appliances and other accessories.</b> 
</p><p>Professional Services: 
</p><p>Professional services include on-location, hands-on experts that plan, design, and deploy security solutions tailored to the company’s end-customers’ specific requirements. It does not directly provide such professional services to its end-customers. Instead, <b>the company primarily delivers these resources through its authorized partners.</b> These services include application traffic management, solution design and planning, configuration, and firewall migration. 
</p><p>Its education services provide classroom-style training and are primarily delivered through its authorized partners. 
</p><p>Major Product Development Projects: 
</p><p>The company invested in strengthening its product portfolio, which resulted in various new product offerings during the year ended ended July 31, 2013. These <b>new product offerings include the VM-Series, an all-software virtualized next-generation firewall platform that brings next-generation network security into the virtualized data center environment; the paid subscription service for WildFire, the company’s cloud-based modern malware prevention service platform; the WF-500 appliance, which provides the ability to deploy WildFire in a customer's private cloud; the PA-3000 Series firewalls that provide mid-range appliance options for enterprise customers; and the M-100 management appliance, which deploys appliance for its Panorama management system. </b>
