<p>"<b>The Diva or the Data?</b>
</p><p>A <b>Lady Gaga CD</b> is one of the last things one would expect to cause what many consider the worst network intrusion and insider threat this year. But that’s what investigators say happened when a 22-year old intelligence analyst, <b>Bradley Manning, allegedly copied documents</b> from a classified system while pretending to play the pop diva’s music in a disc drive.
</p><p><b>The security breach could have been prevented, some analysts say, if the organization had been using the File Sanitization Tool (FiST) from Tresys Technology, which filters, disinfects and does deep content inspection</b> of removable media such as USB drives, CDs, DVDs and files in mission critical environments. FiST also stores whatever malicious hidden content it might find for future forensic analysis.
</p><p>“If the guards at the desk had checked the CD through FiST first, the technology would have caught the breach. Since FiST checks the nature of content, it would have revealed that the Lady Gaga CD was really blank,” said Bob Stalick, Tresys managing director of products.
</p><p>For comprehensive data leakage protection, <b>Tresys integrated FiST with ITT’s PuriFile content inspection application this fall. “PuriFile was designed to detect information not caught in the process of reliable human review</b>,” said John Ivory, director of ITT innovation and commercialization.
</p><p>FiST identifies malicious code, viruses, Trojans, rootkits (which intentionally obscure a system compromise), malformed software and <b>steganography</b> (Greek for “concealed writing”). Unlike cryptography, <b>steganography is the science of writing hidden messages that are so subtle as not to appear to be encrypted messages</b>. One example would be adjusting the color of every 50th pixel in an image to correspond to a letter in the alphabet.
</p><p><b>FiST removes the code in question</b>, rendering the media safe for use and preventing it from infecting DoD systems. FiST and PuriFile provide support for many file types, including various Microsoft products, NX PowerLite, a compression tool, as well as IronKey and MXI, which provides hardware-based government-approved encryption. “PuriFile verifies that FiST really did clean everything out. It’s the final seal of approval,” Stalick said.
</p><p>“FiST is designed to pass only known good content, as opposed to scanning only known bad content, which is what virus scanners do. Most of the changes we made to the latest version, FiST 4.0, were the result of field testing in theater,” said Stalick.
</p><p>“FiST was designed to deal with removable media as a mechanism for introducing subversive code into networks,” Stalick said. <b>FiST makes use of core Assured File Transfer (AFT) technology, a cross domain solution</b> used to allow authorized users at a higher security classification domain to share files such as Microsoft Office, XML, .pdf and imagery file formats securely with a lower security classification domain and the reverse. AFT provides the ability for domains of differing security classifications to clean files before sending them to one another by enforcing and authenticating file transfer security policies through the use of anomaly detection, pattern analysis and event logging, for example.
</p><p><b>The Tresys security product is a dedicated system that comprises software and a Dell laptop with hardware specifications customized specifically for enhanced security. “FiST is sold as an integrated system to ensure that all of the attributes of the hardware are correctly implemented and the software is securely configured for the hardware</b>,” said Stalick.
</p><p><b>MXI Security also integrated its technology into Tresys FiST</b> this year. MXI offers military-grade solutions to protect network access from the problem of removable media. The <b>MXI Stealth Processor is a dedicated, portable security processor for USB devices available in the FIPS 140-2, Level 3 standard with AES-256 hardware encryption and multifactor authentication</b>.
</p><p>In the event of a breach or <b>for fast intelligence gathering and forensics operations, Harris Corp. recently released out a USB thumb drive that locates and extracts targeted data from computers quickly. Called Blackjack, the product was created for use by military, intelligence and law enforcement cyber-security missions</b>. The device boots in a few seconds, then instantly scans and copies data by using prioritized search criteria. LED indicators confirm whether the targeted data is present in order to determine quickly whether the computer of interest is of any value."
