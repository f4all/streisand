<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h3>
<p>The Endace story
</p><p>Our commercial genesis in 2001 was with the manufacture of the first high-speed DAG® I/O cards. A family of DAG cards capable of capturing 100% of network traffic from the full range of network interfaces – Ethernet (10/100/1000), 10GigE, SONET/SDH, PDH/TDM, and Infiniband options – was subsequently developed.
</p><p>By 2005 our DAG cards were in use in major telcos, government agencies, and financial institutions around the globe. Through working with our Tier 1 customers, we identified the need for a purpose-built capture system based on our proven DAG technology, and we started developing our EndaceProbe™ and EndaceSensor™ families which were launched in 2007.
</p><p>Powered by our next-generation network monitoring and recording architecture, our families of EndaceProbe and EndaceSensor systems offer a wide range of configurations suitable for monitoring network segments from the edge to the core of a network, and supporting every network type.
</p><p>Thanks to the power of the underlying Endace Platform, which combines an open, Linux-based operating system – OSm – with a sophisticated software stack, Endace Systems are capable of monitoring multiple network segments simultaneously, delivering 100% packet capture, nanosecond accurate timestamping, and providing a single, authoritative source of captured network traffic to any application that requires it for monitoring, measurement, analysis, security, forensics, and other network functions.
</p><p>The underlying OS and software stack of the Endace Platform enables Endace Systems to be connected together in a centrally deployed and managed ‘fabric’ providing the power to see all across an entire network – even on complex networks that span the globe. Each system is capable of running multiple network monitoring and recording applications – including in-house custom applications, open-source applications, and best-of-breed commercial applications from a wide selection of Endace Partners.
</p><p>In addition, Endace Systems come with EndaceVision –delivering immediate out-of-the-box value by providing solutions to a wide range of common network requirements, such as IDS, network analysis and forensics, packet forwarding, and more.
