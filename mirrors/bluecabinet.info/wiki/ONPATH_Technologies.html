<p>Lawful Interception
</p><p><b>ONPATH 3900, </b>
<b>ONPATH 2900</b> scalable and dense physical layer switching systems
The NetQuest OptiCop is a purpose-built monitoring access solution that allows existing Ethernet-based monitoring tools to attach to any network, regardless of transport technology or speed, enabling customers to access their IP traffic from within transport technologies such as Packet-over-SONET (PoS).
The ONPATH UCS 3900 Packet Blade currently serves as a Network Packet Broker (NPB) by filtering and aggregating 1/10/40Gbps Ethernet traffic, improving access and utilization of monitoring and security tools. The UCS 3900 solution allows network managers to reduce costs by centralizing operations, monitoring services, and network security. Combining the UCS 3900 solution with the OptiCop extends traffic visibility out to telco interfaces, providing valuable insights into network and application performance.
Access to packet traffic on telco circuits for automated network survey and selective traffic targeting in support of Lawful Intercept and Cyber Security applications. Integrating the OptiCop with the ONPATH UCS 3900 provides a seamless solution to access, filter, and aggregate packet traffic throughout the network.
</p><p>The 2900 is on the DoD Approved Product Vendor List (APL). This process simplifies procurement for government agencies. 
The Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) was deployed through the certification of the 2900 by the JITC. The DISN provides connectivity between legacy video, serial data and voice services delivered over Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET), Ethernet, wide area networks and the Fiber Channel. This capability allows for remote switching to devices in operation and preconfigured backup devices when maintenance is in session or a failure occurs. 
</p><p><b>ONPATH’s HorizON™</b> management and monitoring software
</p><p>HorizON 3.0 delivers the industry's most scalable Layer 1 switching and Layers 2-4 packet flow platform to address the ever-expanding requirements of today's data center environments. HorizON 3.0 delivers features to support the highest levels of network intelligence, user simplicity, and system security for the latest high-performance connectivity and network monitoring access applications. The new release includes:-Simple drag-and-drop or point-and-click graphical interface, enabling physical layer and packet flow connections to be made instantaneously; -Centralized visibility across dozens of switches and over 100,000 ports, enabling customers to significantly scale network monitoring access solutions; - Intelligent Layer 1-4 feature control, including connection, TAP, low-latency multicast, filtering, aggregation, load balancing, packet slicing, and source ID tagging from a common management system; -Reporting dashboards and tools to easily track utilization and packet flows on a per system, port, or flow level, improving centralized management and tracking of all resources; -Advanced security features including secure role-based control with Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA), port locking, RADIUS and TACACS+, SNMP Traps, and Syslog; and -An open API, enabling 3rd party software and systems integration Part of ONPATH's Universal Connectivity System (UCS), which also includes the UCS 3900 and 2900 switching systems, HorizON is a Linux-based server software solution that provides centralized management and monitoring of ONPATH's UCS platforms from any local or remote location. HorizON also supports inter-switch connections between ONPATH 3900 and 2900 switch families, enabling customers with seamless growth between ONPATH's UCS platforms. HorizON software supports automated connection management from as few as 16 ports in a 48-port single rack unit blade or system, to over 100,000 ports in a meshed switching architecture. The platform securely supports any combination of Ethernet, Fibre Channel, Serial/PDH/SONET/SDH, and OTN traffic. Each port can be individually licensed to support the industry's widest ranges of speeds and protocols, from copper RS-232 to over 100 Gbps optical Ethernet, and virtually everything in between.

</p><p>ONPATH Technologies Inc. and G.E.T. POWER Pvt. Ltd. (GET Engineering) are deploying cost savings solutions for the United States Navy. The Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) is a tactical information processing protocol designed by the Navy to automate the collection of combat information data such as positioning of aircraft, ships, and submarine targets, as well as navigational information into an overall tactical picture. This vital communications link is one of the core interfaces of the Aegis weapons targeting system. GET's MIL-STD-1397 NTDS to Fiber Optic Converters are used by Naval Test and Training facilities to provide an interface that converts deterministic NTDS signals traveling through bulky, expensive copper cables into signals that can then travel on smaller, lighter fiber optic cables. GET's converters are enabling the Navy to reduce the volume of copper cables used for transferring critical tactical and navigation data, while also enabling communication signals to be transmitted over longer distances. Power and cooling requirements are greatly reduced. ONPATH's Universal Connectivity System (UCS), including its HorizON(TM) Software, is a high performance connectivity and monitoring solution that is speed and protocol agnostic across a range of less than 1 Mbit per second to over 100 Gbits per second. It therefore delivers an advanced platform to automate moves and changes of NTDS and Fiber Optic connections in order to help network managers conserve time, increase utilization, and save money compared to manual patching or complex switching architectures. The UCS platform is providing the switching component for GET's NTDS to Fiber Converters being utilized by the Navy. In addition to the U.S. Navy, ONPATH provides solutions to other Government agencies, including the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force, as well as Fortune 1,000 companies. Because of the compact size and extremely dense port count of ONPATH's new UCS 3900 platform, it is now deployable directly onboard ships. The 3900 will provide the ability to connect tactical targeting sensors and navigational data to weapons platforms in order to provide critical situational awareness.
</p><p><b>Simena, LLC</b>
</p><p>ONPATH Technologies Inc. and Simena, LLC announced a strategic partnership to add the lowest latency aggregation, filtering, and monitoring switch, the Simena Packet Flow Switch (PFS) into ONPATH's UCS suite. The PFS employs Layer 2-4 technology to aggregate, filter, disseminate, and load-balance network traffic to a variety of devices, including monitoring, measurement, and security tools. The PFS enables customers to optimize the performance and investment of these expensive tools, while allowing network managers to reduce cost by centralizing operations, monitoring services, and enhancing network security. Designed to help users increase productivity in monitoring and troubleshooting, the PFS provides flexibility with test configurations through the use of existing network tools, while saving valuable SPAN ports on switches. The Packet Flow Switch delivers such advanced features as, aggregation of several traffic streams to a single network tool; packet filtering to enable users to pick and choose specific packets to be forwarded, packet slicing to enable users to forward only the configurable portions of a packet, increasing throughput and maximizing the performance of attached monitoring systems, Port Tagging to mark packets with the port IDs where they are received, enabling the identification of packet origins, and scaling up to 100,000 ports when used in conjunction with the UCS. In addition, the PFS provides the ability to run all of these advanced features at full wire speed, without impacting performance, to provide unprecedented flexibility and complete control in forwarding packets with an unlimited number of connectivity options. With the addition of the Simena's PFS to ONPATH's Physical Layer product suite, the UCS is now expanded to provide the industry's most complete Layer 1 through 4 connectivity and monitoring solution across Enterprise and Federal applications. With speed- and protocol-independent connectivity ranging from RS-232 to 100Gbps and beyond, including standard protocols such as Ethernet, Fiber Channel, and SONET, as well as proprietary protocols, the ONPATH solution provides monitoring of performance and security applications across virtually any network infrastructure. ONPATH enables customers to increase their overall network security, reliability, and performance; increase the utilization of existing data center, monitoring, and security tools; monitor more with less budget and personnel; simplify the operation of their network; manage change more quickly; and adhere to compliance mandates.
