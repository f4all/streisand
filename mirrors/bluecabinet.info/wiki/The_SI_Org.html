</p><p>Assigned to Matrix Rotation at Lockheed Martin Situational Awareness supporting the Cyber Intelligence Environment Prototype (CIEP).
Designed, developed, and deployed as the backend to CIEP the Protected Online Managed Access Collaboration System (POMACS). This development effort was spawned to demonstrate a development environment that could be rapidly deployed, be agile, robust, scalable, and comply with PL3+ requirements for multi-level security (MLS). This tool suite integrates a combination of COTS and custom applications, which make use of open source materials and Web 2.0 technologies. Core functions include things that most collaborative environments have like: user/group management, shared calendars, user created Workspaces, RSS Feed Integration, and a Content Management System. Additionally, we did integration with some external Mapping Appliances, integration with IP Geolocation Services/Google Maps, LDAP/PKI integration and added some other proprietary features. All of these features, however, operate in compliance with the PL3 and MLS requirements.
o POMACS was design and implemented using a modified LAMP stack.
o Engineered to adhere to NIST and DCID 6/3 PL3+ security requirements factored into the core and adheres to the security and integrity principles/requirements that will be required by Customer Environments.
