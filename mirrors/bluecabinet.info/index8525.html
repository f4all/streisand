** [http://www.barraguard.com/Network-Web-Filters.asp Network Web Filters - various models] with photos
** [http://www.barraguard.com/410.asp Barracuda Web Filter-410] with photo 

* "The '''Barracuda Web Filter''' is a complete '''content filtering and application blocking''' solution designed to enforce acceptable Internet usage policies by blocking access to objectionable content and unauthorized Internet applications. Through the ability to easily block or allow Internet applications, administrators have the power to better secure the network perimeter, limit bandwidth usage and eliminate unwanted communications... 

For most Internet applications, the Barracuda Web Filter can '''control applications efficiently by profiling the ports and destination IP addresses used by those applications'''. However, peer-to-peer applications such as Skype communicate with other peers at varied IP addresses rather than centralized servers, and they utilize a number of fallback ports that include commonly used ports for other protocols, including HTTP and HTTPS. To be able '''to perform application blocking on applications such as Skype, the Barracuda Web Filter utilizes real-time packet inspection technology to analyze protocols independent of their port or destination email server'''. By integrating the protocol analysis with policy controls, the Barracuda Web Filter enables control of peer-to-peer applications based on time range, user, group, or subnet.
