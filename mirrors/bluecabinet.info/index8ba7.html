'''Investors''' [Note: need to identify names of investors, not just countries]

"Underpinning the growth and success of Investcorp is its '''unique fund raising ability'''. This results from the unmatched personal service that we provide to our investor base of prime institutions and '''top tier high-net-worth individuals in the six Gulf Co-operation Council countries of the Arabian Gulf: the Kingdom of Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates'''.  The GCC region is the world's fastest growing wealth market, and we see Gulf investors continuing to increase their allocation of investable wealth to alternative investment products of the type we offer..."
