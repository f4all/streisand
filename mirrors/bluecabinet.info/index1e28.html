Furthermore, <b>Glimmerglass leverages purely optical, photonic signal management to create a ‘transparent’ cross-connect</b>. A transparent cross-connect accepts and reconfigures an optical signal without regard for its data rate or protocol. This means that a Glimmerglass IOS that manages 1G to 10G data rate signals today can manage 40G or 100G signals once the network evolves, without the need for hardware or even software upgrades." <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.glimmerglass.com/solutions/cyber-security-and-lawful-interception/">Glimmerglass</a>
