=== Background ===

"TIBCO Software Inc. (NASDAQ: TIBX) is a provider of infrastructure software for companies to use on-premise or as part of cloud computing environments. Whether it's efficient claims or trade processing, cross-selling products based on real-time customer behavior, or averting a crisis before it happens, TIBCO provides companies the two-second advantage® – the ability to capture the right information, at the right time, and act on it preemptively for a competitive advantage..."

=== Products ===

* '''TIBCO SPOTFIRE''' 

[http://spotfire.tibco.com/en/discover-spotfire/who-uses-spotfire/by-industry/government.aspx Government]: "There are '''over 65 US Government agencies presently using TIBCO Spotfire including the CIA, DIA, NSA, INSCOM, NGA, DARPA, DTRA''' and several civilian agencies, and we are certified and accredited to run on '''DoD's classified networks (JWICS, SIPRNET and NIPRNET)'''.

* '''TIBCO's Event-Enabled Platform Harnesses Big Data to Transform CSPs''' [http://www.tibco.com/products/event-enabled-enterprise/default.jsp] 

"This combinatorial skill – to unlock meaningful value from series of historical data and activity in motion – is the power of an event-enabled enterprise. Rather than analyzing massive amounts of information in a one-time effort, it processes data in real time as things change – continuously deciphering the meaning of what’s happening in the moment based on what’s known from the past...

How It Works: Understand. Anticipate. Act.

Registering activity across the enterprise, it can sense when opportunities and risks are coming and systematically ensure the right person (or system) has the right information before outcomes crystallize – what TIBCO calls the two-second advantage®.

Whether it's two minutes or two hours, it's an opportunity to take action before outcomes crystallize, redirect the course of activity, and optimize results.

The Building Blocks

* Automation: Ensure real-time information is available and can be accessed, consumed, and acted on by any application, person, or process across geographical boundaries, channels, and touch points

* Event Processing: Understand the cause of opportunities and risks so you can track and act on when they happen next

* Analytics: Find actionable insights at the speed of thought by enabling users to spot patterns, examine outliers, and share trends in data

* Cloud: Meet fluctuating demands with an efficiency that optimizes your IT cost structure.

* Social: Allow employees, customers, and partners to collaborate with each other and interact with information located in any system



* '''TIBCO [http://www.tibbr.com/whatstibbr.html tibbr] Social Computing'''
 
"tibbr has deep, pre-configured business and application integrations for SAP, Salesforce.com, Oracle, and Microsoft SharePoint, to name just a few... The tibbr REST API makes it easy to integrate enterprise applications written in any language. Virtually every part of the tibbr interface – including subjects, user profiles, tibbr posts, and streams – can be accessed via the tibbr REST API to interact with other enterprise applications and systems... Our SmartWidgets deliver relevant subjects and conversations in tibbr alongside intranet portals, CRM systems, ERP, expense management, and other key enterprise applications."
