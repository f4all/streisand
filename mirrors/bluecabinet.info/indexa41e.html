=== Background ===

Private Company

* Predictive Policing (PredPol) Software had its first trial use in Santa Cruz, California, [http://web.archive.org/web/20121017021640/http://math.scu.edu/~gmohler/predpol.html] as "Santa Cruz Experimental Predictive Policing Software.

"The software was created by a pair of academics, George Mohler, a professor of mathematics at Santa Clara University; and Jeff Brantingham, a UCLA professor of anthropology. And the company was founded with $1.5 million worth of investment from high-tech industry luminaries like Ken Cannappan, CEO and president of Plantronics Inc., the Santa Cruz-based headset company; Rob Chesnut, senior vice president and general counsel at Chegg Inc., the Santa Clara-based provider of online college textbooks; and Andreas Weigand, lecturer at Stanford University and former chief scientist at Amazon.com Inc.

Company officials negotiated an exclusive licensing agreement with Santa Clara University to market the software product, according to '''Mayor Ryan Coonerty of Santa Cruz. Coonerty, who said he is helping PredPol deal with government relations issues, said his city has also been able to use the PredPol software free of charge'''. He said '''the software uses an algorithm, or step-by-step procedure for calculations, based on historical data''' to determine the timing and location of criminal activity..."

"''the software uses an algorithm, or step-by-step procedure for calculations, based on historical data''' to determine the timing and location of criminal activity..." [http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2012/06/11/new-santa-cruz-company-to-plead-case.html?page=all]

" “Each box represents a 500 foot square area. The algorithm is telling us it’s an important part of the area to police. In the last 180 days, you’ve had a burglary, three vehicle crimes, four violent crimes and four criminal damages. The boxes are all lettered, so from A to Z. A, B, C, D are the most high priority... 

The crime prediction boxes are the result of the same calculations used to predict earthquakes. Using records crime data and human behaviour, the system predicts areas where offences are likely to take place. Officers receive updates from the system twice a day and then decide where to patrol." [http://www.euronews.com/2013/02/25/forecasting-crime/]

"It is meant to predict the likelihood of any given crime being committed within a 500-square-foot-area, based on the people which frequent that area. It knows who you are through gait analysis and facial recognition. It also computes sociological data on the citizenry as well, it seems." [http://www.thrivenotes.com/predpol-tacoma/]

"The tool is run on a secure, cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform... information available immediately where and when it is needed.

* delivery report on paper, to smart phone, or to tablet

* 500′ x 500′ place-based prediction boxes

* crime mapped instantaneously

* specific to crime type

* specific to shifts

* crime mapping &amp; prediction settings

"For officers, PredPol’s information is accessible from any tech device or on paper.

For analysts, PredPol’s tool can be set up within days and generates its actionable predictions in one click of your mouse.

For managers, there is no new hardware, no additional technical staff, and no budget-busting installation fees. Training is simple, short, and intuitive. A very competitive annual subscription cost keeps the program running.

===== Donnie Fowler =====

Fifteen Years of High Tech Business Development and Policy Experience in Silicon Valley and Washington, DC; 

Work in the Clinton White House and at the Federal Communications Commission

"Fowler has worked in the Clinton White House, at the Federal Communications Commission, as vice president at Silicon Valley’s TechNet, and as a founder of two companies that cross the technology and public spaces. His firm, Dogpatch Strategies, and his partnerships with various companies center around business development and strategic communications for organizations that are leading innovators in their space and that often provide a public good. For example, he led Facebook's first efforts into political campaigns during the 2006 congressional elections, organized California's clean tech industry in its successful fight to protect the state's clean energy law (known as AB32) during 2012's Proposition 23 fight, and has an ongoing senior business development role with PredPol, a company founded in 2012 that provides crime prediction software to police in the United States and abroad.

'''In politics, Fowler has worked at the state and national level on the presidential campaigns of Dick Gephardt, Jesse Jackson, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Wes Clark, John Kerry, and Barack Obama.''' He also worked as a Clinton White House staffer as a liaison to Congress for presidential appointments and as a presidential appointee at the Federal Communications Commission where he dealt with broadband Internet, cable television, and satellite issues.

Fowler was Al Gore's National Field &amp; Delegates Director during the 2000 presidential campaign, managing the in-state political operations for Gore's victory over Bill Bradley for the Democratic nomination and the popular vote victory over George W. Bush in the general election. He was General Wesley Clark's first campaign manager in 2003 ran John Kerry's 2004 winning campaign in the state of Michigan, and was senior advisor in Indiana for Barack Obama's victory there (the first time a Democratic presidential candidate won the Hoosier state since 1964).

Following the 2004 election, Fowler ran for the DNC Chairmanship, receiving the second highest-level of support behind eventual winner and former Vermont governor Howard Dean. Similar to Dean, Fowler called for the Democratic Party to broaden its approach to voters and look to state and county parties for its message and its growth.

Fowler is a graduate of the University of Virginia and the University of South Carolina School of Law. He is the son of former Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Donald Fowler." Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnie_Fowler Wikipedia]

"Donnie Fowler has achieved a '''leading role in both political and high technology circles through his work in the Clinton White House''', at the '''Federal Communications Commission''' in Washington, as vice president at '''TechNet''' in Silicon Valley, and with political campaigns in every corner of the United States. He has advised dozens of companies, policymakers, public advocacy groups, and political campaigns on how to successfully manage their media, policy, and business development agendas. '''Currently, he leads Dogpatch Strategies, a communications and public affairs firm''' serving green technology enterprises, and continues to support '''Cherry Tree Mobile media''', a mobile technology company he co-founded in 2006. 

Fowler’s political background includes on the ground work in fifteen states and five of the '''last six presidential campaign cycles'''. He was '''Al Gore’s National Field &amp; Delegates Director''', contributing to the only Democratic campaign to win every state in a competitive nomination fight and supporting the eventual popular vote victory against George Bush. Following the 2004 election, Fowler finished second in the contest for Democratic National Chairman behind eventual winner Howard Dean. '''Most recently, he was senior state advisor to the Obama campaign in Indiana, the first Democratic presidential win there since 1964'''. 

Fowler’s recent professional work has included '''clients as varied as Facebook, Stanford University, the Pew Charitable Trust, Al Gore (“Inconvenient Truth” and The Alliance for Climate Protection), the Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, MyPoints Online, CNET News, EnTrust Capital Management, SolarTech, Greenvolts Inc., Amgen, and the Biotech Industry Organization'''.  He has made frequent appearances in local and national media on political and technology issues, including Fox News, “Dan Rather Reports” (HDNet), The Washington Post, LA Times, San Jose Mercury News, and as a '''blogger for the Huffington Post'''. 

Fowler is '''senior fellow at the Truman National Security Project''' and an alumnus of the American Council of Young Political Leaders, finishing his second trip to China in August 2009. He was also an appointee of Governor Gray Davis to California’s Long-Term Economic Strategy Panel, charged with setting a long-term strategy for California’s economy.  

Fowler received his B.A. from the University of Virginia and his law degree from the University of South Carolina where he attended on a full scholarship.  He is a South Carolina native and has lived in San Francisco since 2001."  Source:
