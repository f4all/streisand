=== Background ===

Solera Networks serves customers in government, financial, energy, cloud, retail, and high tech markets. 

"Alan Hall, the firm's marketing director - who has had several years of experience with Novell - said that his firm's technology - which is '''used by a variety of government agencies - allows IT managers to go beyond deep level packet inspection by logging all aspects of network traffic on both physical and virtual systems'''.

The resultant data, he says, can then be analysed at leisure and allows IT managers to forensically analyse... 
Solera's '''deep packet capture''', as it is known, is billed as streaming network data at much faster speeds than other companies." [http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/1679/infosecurity-europe-firms-get-access-to-military-grade-forensics InfoSecurity]
