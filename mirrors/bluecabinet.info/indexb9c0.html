<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Products">Products</span></h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Product Lines</b> 
</li>
</ul>
<p>The company’s <b>IPE solutions</b> are powered by its three primary product lines: 
</p><p><b>PacketLogic Subscriber Manager (PSM)</b>
</p><p>The PSM <b>integrates PacketLogic with network management and operation systems, including AAA, OSS, BSS, provisioning and policy managers</b>. This integration enables policy enforcement, <b>per-user tracking</b>, also known as user awareness, as well as <b>knowledge of where in the network the user connects (location awareness)</b>. User awareness could be utilized to create personalized offerings for new customers through value-add services. Location awareness makes it possible to resolve, or even avoid, congestion, improving the user-experience. It could also control roaming costs through automatic policy enforcement. 
</p><p><br />
<b>PacketLogic Intelligence Center (PIC)</b>
</p><p>PIC with PacketLogic Report Studio provides the visualization of the application and subscriber intelligence gathered by deployed PacketLogic systems. Utilizing the subscriber and location awareness provided by the PSM and the application intelligence provided by the PacketLogic Real-Time Enforcement Platform (PRE), the <b>PIC is able to present a wealth of information to the network operator</b> based on the behavior of their network. The PIC gives network managers access to relevant network traffic intelligence that enables network optimization, creation of appealing services, and protection against malicious behavior. 
</p><p><br />
<b>PRE</b>
</p><p><b>PRE utilizes multiple hardware platforms that run the same operating software</b> offering high performance and capacity. Each of the platforms offers features enabled through the different PacketLogic software modules, including <b>LiveView, Filtering</b>, Traffic Shaping, and Statistics. 
</p><p>The <b>PacketLogic hardware platforms</b> offer a range of configurations from the entry-level 4 Mbps PL5600 through 2 Gbps PL7720. The mid-range PL8720 is a 2RU unit with up to 10Gbps throughput.
