=== Background ===
July 29, 2010: '''Narus a private company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company''', operating within Boeing's '''Network &amp; Space Systems''' business. [http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1358], which provides real-time network traffic and analytics software.  Narus and The Boeing Company and is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California with '''regional offices around the world'''. [http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=31847 Businessweek]

It was co-founded in Israel in 1997 by Ori Cohen – who had served as Vice President of Business and Technology Development for VDONet, an early media streaming pioneer – and Stas Khirman.It became a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing in 2010. According to the Narus website, Cohen and Khirman are not members of the Board.

Narus is notable for being '''the creator of NarusInsight, a supercomputer system''' [http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/surveillance/files/2008/11/nss.png Diagram] whose installation in AT&amp;T's San Francisco Internet backbone gave rise to a 2006 class action lawsuit by the Electronic Frontier Foundation against AT&amp;T, ''Hepting v. AT&amp;T''. [Source: ]

Prior to 9/11 Narus worked on building carrier-grade tools to analyze IP network traffic for billing purposes, to prevent what they term "revenue leakage". Post-9/11 they have continued down that path while '''adding more semantic monitoring abilities for surveillance purposes'''.

* '''In 2004, Narus engaged the former Deputy Director of the National Security Agency, William Crowell as a director'''. 

"Crowell is an independent security consultant and holds several board positions with a variety of technology and technology-based security companies. Since 9/11, Crowell has served on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Task Force on Terrorism and Deterrence, the National Research Council Committee on Science and Technology for Countering Terrorism and the '''Markle Foundation Task Force on National Security in the Information Age'''."

'''[ NarusInsight 8]''' Real Time IP Traffic Monitoring, Traffic Intelligence

* 3.6.2012: Narus, Inc. Announces Latest Product Upgrade: '''NarusInsight 8 Traffic Intelligence and Analytics System'''

Narus, Inc. unveiled NarusInsight 8, which continues the company' tradition of delivering situational awareness in an ever-changing cyber environment. The latest release fully supports IPv6, keeping pace with industry and government organizations as they adopt new standards.

NarusInsight 8 also offers improved efficiency for existing software and enhanced performance for more powerful hardware. Support for additional system hardening required for government environments rounds out NarusInsight 8. With this release, the company continues its leadership in providing enhanced situational awareness with its real-time traffic intelligence and analytics. 

NarusInsight now supports more than 1,000 netflow sources with more than 2,500 interfaces. 

NarusInsight comes complete with embedded connectors to world-class data warehouses such as Teradata and SEIMs such as ArcSight. 

'''Precision targeting provides packet capture capabilities for deep analytics and session reconstruction without the need for additional packet capture applications.''' 

NarusInsight leverages a scalable, flexible and powerful architecture and a combination of patented, real-time traffic intelligence and cyber analytics to provide unique insight into the quality of the network and traffic and subsequently the security of any critical infrastructure. NarusInsight offers a total network view of heterogeneous networks, and provides deep insight into multiple layers of network traffic. 

The information is provided in real time, enabling customers to see clearly what is happening in their networks from Layer 2 though Layer 7, and use this information to quickly mitigate malicious activity and optimize network assets. Network operators are able to proactively guard against cyber threats and maintain the integrity, quality and efficiency of their network and data. 

NarusInsight 8 offers some key features and functionality that protect against cyber threats and evolve with the threat landscape, setting it apart from its industry peers. Support for IPv6: this latest release extends NarusInsight's real-time capture and processing capabilities to include IPv6. This is especially critical for government and large international organizations (healthcare and financial institutions included) that are leading the charge in adopting the latest industry standard. Most of security solutions operate using IPv4, and are unable to correctly parse and identify IPv6 connections. Cyber criminals seize on this lapse in visibility, creating IPv6 connections that are ignored by security solutions, and easily slipping into a network. With NarusInsight 8, the same features and functionality from previous releases supporting IPv4 are carried over to the IPv6 version; increased efficiency, enhanced performance, improved scalability - With NarusInsight 8, existing software efficiency is increased by 25% on average, with no need for investment in new hardware. 

'''This ability to process vast quantities of data efficiently (at 10Gb/s''') with no extra expenditure is a huge draw in today's cost-conscious economy. Moreover, NarusInsight 8 now supports more powerful hardware. This, combined with the efficient processing of large amounts of data, combines to deliver the perfect solution, even for big data environments; system hardening: especially critical for government, financial services and healthcare organizations, '''NarusInsight 8 supports system hardening. This functionality reduces the areas of vulnerability by removing unnecessary software and disabling applications, thereby closing ports that may be easy entry points for hackers looking to invade a network.'''

"The software, created by a company called '''Narus that’s now part of Boeing, is controlled remotely from NSA headquarters''' at Fort Meade in Maryland and searches US sources for target addresses, locations, countries, and phone numbers, as well as watch-listed names, keywords, and phrases in email." [http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/all/1 WIRED] 

'''It is possible that such technology is used to control and monitor Politics and Economy.'''

It has been proven from '''HBGary''' leaked e-mails that the U.S planned to install such systems in Libya to have control of the countries oil, economy, and politics. The leaks also showed that '''Unveillance project Cyber Dawn''' was involved in this. [http://www.unveillance.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Project_Cyber_Dawn_Public.pdf] 

It is possible that CIA agents also have access to these systems in certain countries, which may help them to target individual users/groups or fight terrorism.['''needs citation''']
