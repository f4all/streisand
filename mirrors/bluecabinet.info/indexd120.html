=== Background ===

"Level 3 Communications, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, operates as a facilities-based provider of a range of integrated communications services. 

* Strategy 

The company’s strategy is to deploy network infrastructure in major metropolitan areas and to link these networks with significant intercity and trans-oceanic networks in North America, Europe, and Latin America. 

* Service Offerings 

* Core Network Services Transport Services: 

Transport services include wavelengths, private lines, transoceanic services, and dark fiber, as well as related professional services. These services are available across its metropolitan and intercity fiber network. 

'''Wavelength services''' provide unprotected point-to-point connections of a fixed amount of bandwidth with Ethernet or synchronous optical network (SONET) interfaces. Wavelength services are available at a range of speeds from 1 Gpbs to 100 Gbps. This service offering targets customers that require significant amounts of bandwidth, desire more direct control and provide their own network management. Private line services are also point-to-point connections of dedicated bandwidth but include SONET or synchronous digital hierarchy protection to provide resiliency to fiber or equipment outages. Private line services are available in a range of speeds with electrical, optical and Ethernet interfaces. 

The company also provides transport services within its '''transatlantic cable system connecting North America, Europe and Latin America, as well as via leased bulk capacity on other transoceanic systems. International backhaul transport services, interconnecting cable landing stations and its terrestrial North American, European and Latin American networks, are also available.''' 

The company’s '''dark fiber service''' provides carriers, service providers, government entities and enterprises a fiber solution when applications, control or scale requirements make this service desirable. This includes fiber, colocation space in its Gateway and in its network facilities, power and physical operations and maintenance of the fiber and associated infrastructure. Professional services related to its transport and data services include network architectural design, engineering, installation and turn-up, ongoing network monitoring and management services, and field technical services. 


* Colocation and Data Center Services: 

Colocation and Data Center services include data center facilities and services, including cloud, hosting, and application management solutions.

These services allow service providers, enterprises and government entities to replace multiple networks with a single solution that simplifies the transmission of voice, video, and data over a single or converged network, while delivering service and security. These services are used for service provider and corporate data and voice networks, data center networking, disaster recovery and out-of-region or redundant customer connectivity for other service providers. 

VPN services are sold stand-alone or in conjunction with its managed services offerings.

The service includes the essential building blocks required for residential or business voice service, such as local phone numbers, local number portability, local and long distance calling, 911, operator assistance, directory listings, and directory assistance.

SIP Trunking is a VoIP-based local phone service offered to medium and large enterprises as a replacement for traditional fully featured enterprise time division multiplexing (TDM) voice services. SIP Trunking allows customers with an IP PBX to manage calls to and from the PSTN without having to purchase traditional access lines dedicated to voice. SIP Trunking includes basic local phone service components, such as local phone numbers, 911, operator assistance, directory listings, local and long distance calling. In addition, customers select from a full set of feature packages that provide core call control features, such as call forwarding, call waiting and call transfer, as well as advanced features, such as unified messaging and one-number identity. 


* Local Inbound: 

The company’s local inbound service terminates traditional telephone network originated calls to IP termination points. Customers, such as call centers, conferencing providers, voice over IP service providers and enterprises, can obtain telephone numbers from the company or port-in local telephone numbers that the customer already controls. 


* PRI:

PRI services come with telephone numbers, operator services, directory assistance and directory listing, 911, as well as routing features, such as inbound redirect and remote call forwarding. Customers are able to utilize its PRI services to access long distance and toll free calling as well.

Medium and large enterprises purchase its long distance services for their corporate calling or outbound contact center needs. All Level 3 long distance services are offered at the customer's option over circuit switch or softswitch technologies. 


* Enterprise Toll Free: 

The company’s toll free service terminates toll free calls that are originated on the traditional telephone network. These toll free calls are carried over either a circuit switch or softswitch network and delivered to customers in IP or traditional TDM format. Within this portfolio are Advanced Toll Free services that provide contact center customers the ability to define and control call handling and advanced routing between the Level 3 network and multiple customer contact center locations. Customers may also combine advanced routing with network-based Intelligent voice response, or IVR, services that drive call routing and handling based on the caller's interaction with the IVR.
