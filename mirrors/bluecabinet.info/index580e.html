</p><p><b>Trapwire INC.'s GSA contract number: GS-35F-0501U</b>
</p><p>"TrapWire Inc. was founded in 2004 to <b>design, build and deploy</b> counterterrorism technologies and services for the protection of critical infrastructure and personnel. The genesis of our company started with a project initiated in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks. The objective of <b>that project</b> was to develop a capability that would prevent such attacks from occurring in the future. This project evolved into our flagship product, TrapWire, <b>and</b> its related methodologies and supporting capabilities.
</p><p>As with all of our products and services, the TrapWire system encapsulates the expertise of professionals in the areas of counterterrorism, <b>surveillance, surveillance detection, and intelligence operations and analysis</b>. Prior to joining TrapWire, many of <b>our employees were directly involved in the U.S. government’s war on terrorism as intelligence officers and members of the US Armed Forces and Secret Service</b>. Our professionals have led successful intelligence operations against terrorist organizations and fought on battlefields across the globe. <b>We view TrapWire as a continuation of our prior service</b>, and as an opportunity to take a proactive stance against terrorism by helping <b>law enforcement and private security agencies</b> identify and disrupt attack planning processes, apprehend perpetrators, and prevent attacks." - Trapwire.com

<p>Trapwire, “ a formerly obscure counter-terrorist surveillance network, created by a company run by ex-CIA agents, that links together thousands of ordinary, privately owned security cameras, digitally analyzing the footage they generate and delivering it to various police departments and branches of the  US federal government,”  says Jesse Brown, Maclean’s magazine.
</p><p>"TrapWire is a unique, predictive software system designed to detect patterns indicative of terrorist attacks or criminal operations. Utilizing a proprietary, rules-based engine, TrapWire detects, analyzes and alerts on suspicious events as they are collected over periods of time and across multiple locations. Through the systematic capture of these pre-attack indicators, terrorist or criminal surveillance and pre-attack planning operations can be identified -- and appropriate law enforcement counter measures employed ahead of the attack. As such, our clients are provided with the ability to prevent the terrorist or criminal event, rather than simply mitigate damage or loss of life.

"Abraxas was formed by former senior U.S. intelligence officers shortly after the attacks of September 11. While much of its work is in the national security realm, the company also offers products and services targeting the private sector security and intelligence market.
</p><p>In the spring of 2003, Abraxas assembled a team with extensive experience in the
areas of counterterrorism, surveillance and surveillance detection operations, and intelligence analysis to create a system capable of detecting the terrorist’s pre-attack activities and thereby provide advanced warning of pending attacks. The objective was to offer
civilian facilities the type of surveillance detection and counterterrorism capabilities found today at high-threat U.S. government sites, only without the significant cost associated with those programs.
</p><p>The system this group devised is called <b>TrapWire</b>, and it promises to provide information on precisely which facilities are being targeted for attack and by whom, as well as valuable insight as to when the attack will occur and against which facility vulnerability.
TrapWire does this by providing a structured format for reporting on suspicious activity near a facility. <b>The structured reporting format instills a level of discipline on collectors and facilitates data mining.</b>
</p><p>Suspicious <b>activity reports from all facilities on the TrapWire network are aggregated in a central database and run through a rules engine</b> that searches for patterns indicative of terrorist surveillance operations and other attack preparations.
</p><p>The strength of TrapWire is the simplicity of the collection formats,
combined with the sophistication of its rules engine. TrapWire
collectors can enter suspicious activity reporting, or what TrapWire
terms “events,” into the system in approximately 60 seconds. The
structured data input mechanism enables collectors to quickly identify
the location and time of the event, the surveillance activity, the
suspected surveillant’s behavior, and a description of any individual
or vehicle involved. 
</p><p>TrapWire is integrated with a site’s existing video
surveillance system, which allows for the easy attachment of video
clips of the suspicious activity to the event report. Once the event
is entered into the database, the TrapWire rules engine analyzes each aspect of the report and compares it to all previously-collected reporting across the entire TrapWire network. 
</p><p><br />
<b>Any patterns detected – links among individuals, vehicles or activities – will be reported back to each affected facility. This information can also be shared with law enforcement organizations, enabling them to begin investigations into the suspected surveillance cell.</b>
The effectiveness of the TrapWire system is dramatically increased through <b>the sharing of suspicious activity reporting</b>. 
</p><p>The terrorist modus operandi for planning an attack begins with the leadership tasking the surveillance cell to find a suitable target for attack. The leaders may provide guidance to the surveillance team regarding the target type (U.S. government building,chemical facility,
etc.) and/or the target’s geographic location (Washington D.C., New York City, etc.). The surveillance cell will then begin to canvass the targets in what is known as the “Target Assessment” phase of the surveillance cycle. This is probably what the al-Qaeda surveillants were doing against the headquarters of Prudential Financial, Inc. and other financial targets in 2001. 
</p><p>The probability of their casing activity being detected at each site would largely depend on the professionalism of the surveillants and the observation skills of the security personnel protecting the targets. However, it is a mathematical certainty that the probability of detection can be significantly increased through the sharing of information. For example, suppose that the terrorists case eight facilities in an effort to find a target with a suitable vulnerability. Let us also assume that the probability of detection of surveillance activity is 10% at each facility. If the eight facilities operate in isolation, the
probability of detection stays at 10%. However, if the facilities share their threat data, the probability of detection increases to 57%. Moreover, once the surveillance cell is detected and the information is communicated across the network of eight facilities, the probability of detection increases again as security personnel now have descriptions of the individuals and vehicles involved in the casing operations, any associated video clips, as well as information on the timing and focus of their activities. In essence, we now know
who they are, at least by sight, and their modus operandi.
</p><p>The sharing of security-related information requires a change in our traditional way of doing business. Information on security, vulnerabilities, and threats are considered sensitive and/or proprietary, and usually for very good reason. 
</p><p><b>However, in building TrapWire, Abraxas included several features designed to overcome the reluctance to sharing security information. First, the system only shares information</b>
on threats to the facility. The type of threat report shared across the network would include the following type of data: “A white male, early thirties, medium build, 5’11” – 6’2”, brown hair, clean shaven, wearing sun glasses was seen videotaping the vehicle entrance to a port facility in the Miami region on 9 October at 9:43 am.” However, no one outside this facility will receive any information on possible vulnerabilities or other security issues at this site. The facility in question will receive additional information, including which facility
vulnerability was under surveillance, from which location, etc.<b> Also note that the facility is referred to as a “port facility in the Miami region.” Each facility can decide for itself how it will be described. It is important, however, that information be provided indicating the target type and region. This allows other facilities on the network and law enforcement authorities to gain insight as to the sector or region targeted by the terrorists. </b>
</p><p>Ultimately, each facility on the network will decide for itself how widely its information
will be shared. With regard to information sharing policies, the network will operate
on a reciprocal basis.
</p><p>The TrapWire system comes with training in terrorist surveillance practices that teaches security personnel, and other potential collectors, how a terrorist organization, or criminal group, conducts surveillance operations. If possible, the training is done at the site to be protected. This allows Abraxas to incorporate the environment surrounding the facility into the training by providing realistic scenarios on how the facility’s neighborhood will be used against it by the terrorists. As a result, the trainees are sensitized to the best locations from which to case their facility, the best times of day to surveil, probable deterrents
to the terrorists, and other factors effecting such operations. This training vastly improves the quality of reporting and the probability that surveillance activity will be detected. 
</p><p>Refresher courses for collectors will be available in computer-based modules later this year.
</p><p>TrapWire is a significant step toward changing our approach to counter-terrorism security in the post-9/11 world. This system moves beyond physical security to provide greater situational and environmental awareness. More importantly, it provides the intelligence
needed to change the balance of forces between the terrorists and site security personnel. 
</p><p>Those protecting critical infrastructure and other high-value sites can now turn the tables on the attackers by exploiting the terrorists’ vulnerability. They can incorporate some of the best practices developed by U.S. government facilities in high-threat areas to prevent attacks on their people and assets.
</p><p>Combining TrapWire with existing security infrastructure – security personnel, video systems, access control systems, etc. – will shift the advantage to those on the defense and dramatically increase the return on investment of existing security infrastructure. This
can be done by refocusing our security resources from protecting against what will happen on the day of the attack, the defenders’ point of maximum vulnerability, to targeting the terrorists during their pre-attack surveillance operations, the terrorists’ point of
maximum vulnerability.

</p><p><b>Integration</b>
</p><p>"The TrapWire system can be <b>integrated</b> with and can utilize most existing surveillance technologies (such as pan-tilt-zoom [PTZ] cameras) to capture photographic or video evidence of suspicious activity.
</p><p>Additionally, SAR data captured in the TrapWire system can be easily transferred to other systems as needed via a standardized XML data file export. This is particularly helpful for Law Enforcement agencies who wish to upload their SAR data to the Information Sharing Environment (ISE), as well as eGuardian. TrapWire allows agencies to output records in the NIEM-compliant SAR-IEPD format. " - Trapwire.com
