: The M86 MailMarshal Secure Email Gateway (SEG) provides total email content security through unified threat management, anti-spam, content security, policy enforcement and data leakage prevention.

Highly scalable, flexible and easy-to-manage, M86 MailMarshal SEG can be deployed as a standalone solution or as a distributed array designed to support the largest networks.

* '''M86 Security, Inc. Releases Latest Version of Web Filtering and Reporting Solutions'''
Dec 9 11 [http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=6586746 Businessweek]

M86 Security, Inc. released latest version 4.2 of its M86 Web Filtering and Reporting (WFR) Suite. This version includes several enhancements, including: '''additional user identification and activity monitoring for all tablet devices''', reporting improvements, customizable time limits for user access, and convenient access to future limited availability releases of the product. With the latest release of the M86 WFR 4.2, M86 Security gives educational institutions and other organizations the critical '''ability to filter all mobile tablet devices running on Android or iOS operating systems while on-premises'''. As schools across the U.S. distribute these tablets to their students, districts need '''to ensure that their Web filtering solutions can authenticate, monitor and report Internet activities of all on-premises tablet users down to the user level, even if the tablets are personally-owned devices students bring into the schools'''. The company said that '''M86 WFR 4.2 provides this capability''', helping schools enforce regulatory compliance and maintain productivity, while introducing new tools on their networks '''without compromising filtering capabilities'''. 

Features of the M86 WFR 4.2, as described by the Company, include:

* '''Tablet User Identification and Activity Monitoring:''' 
Schools and '''other organizations that have tablets running on Android or iOS operating systems will be able to filter on-premises activities by a user's LDAP profile. This enables organizations to know who is using the tablet, rather than a generic IP address'''. 

* Customized Time Settings in Web-based Authentication: 
'''Custom time limits for Web access can be assigned by user group or IP group''', rather than just setting one universal time for all users. This enables schools and other organizations to be more flexible about '''when and for how long various users can access the web'''. 

* Increased On-box Reporting Functionality: 
Schools and other organizations can now '''receive detailed, drill-down security reports''', additional reporting templates and increased consistency between security, productivity and other reporting types, which are many of the same features offered in the M86 Security Reporter.
