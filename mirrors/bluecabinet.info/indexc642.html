<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h3>
<p>"RainStor was founded in 2004 with a team of engineers who conceived the underlying technology as part of an R&amp;D team at The UK’s Ministry of Defense (MoD). Today this same team forms the core of RainStor’s talented engineering organization, which has developed the portfolio of patented intellectual property that underlies today’s RainStor solution...
</p><p>RainStor’s worldwide headquarters is in San Francisco, CA and core engineering team remains in The UK. Business development, sales, marketing and field services teams are located in both Europe and the United States to support both partners and end-user customers."

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Products">Products</span></h3>
<p>RainStor is a database designed to manage Big Data for large enterprises at the lowest total cost.
</p><p>RainStor delivers two editions of its database product, Big Data Retention and Big Data Analytics on Hadoop to efficiently manage multi-structured data sets, fully accessible for ongoing query and analysis helping meet both regulatory compliance in addition to the fastest query and analysis on Hadoop. RainStor’s innovative database stores and manages multi-structured big data in the most efficient and cost-effective way compared to traditional relational or data warehouse approaches.
</p><p>RainStor’s patented technology uses sophisticated data compression and de-duplication techniques to reduce the storage footprint by 95%+ less. Data retained in RainStor can be queried and analyzed directly using SQL, your favorite BI tool or MapReduce on Hadoop without restoring or re-inflating the data. RainStor stores the data in large blocks called partitions that can be easily managed using standard file systems, HDFS and low cost storage platforms which requires very few resources to set-up and maintain, further reducing overall total cost of ownership.
</p><p>Supporting flexible deployment models including cloud and on premise, RainStor can be deployed on a variety of commodity disk options including NAS, CAS, and also the open-source Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). RainStor requires no design, index creation, tuning, or ongoing maintenance.
</p><p>In summary, RainStor enables organizations to store and analyze large, virtually unlimited volumes of multi-structured data with minimal effort, delivering substantial storage, hardware, and operational savings.  Business users can access the data for better business insights. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://rainstor.com/products/overview/">Rainstor products page</a>
